adfa04f5e1e7403dd90f5cddd29b6c37,"The Pentagon on Monday, June 18, 2018, formally suspended a major military exercise planned for August with South Korea, a much-anticipated move stemming from President Donald Trump’s nuclear summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The Pentagon on Monday formally suspended a major military exercise planned for August with South Korea, a much-anticipated move stemming from President Donald Trump’s nuclear summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Dana White, spokeswoman for the Defence Department, said planning for the summer drills has stopped, but there have been no decisions made on any other military exercises with South Korea. Military exercises with other countries in the Pacific will continue.Related Stories India, China military drill promotes ties: Chinese dailyS.Korea, DPRK begins first military talks after 10 yearsThe world has seen more than enough conflict, world deserves future of peace: Donald TrumpKim Jong Un to visit China today, expected to discuss denuclearisation Speaking at a news conference last Tuesday after his summit with Kim, Trump abruptly announced that he was suspending military exercises with the South, “unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should.” He added that dumping the drills will save the U.S. “a tremendous amount of money. Plus, I think it’s very provocative.”His announcement appeared to catch U.S. defense officials by surprise, and his comments ran counter to long-held American arguments that the exercises are critical for effective operations with allies and are defensive in nature. The Pentagon has for years flatly denied North Korean assertions that the exercises are “provocative.”But as the days went by, the U.S. and Seoul began discussions about suspending the large Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises that usually take place in August and possibly other joint drills while nuclear diplomacy with North Korea continues. Seoul’s Defence Ministry said Friday that Defence Minister Song Young-moo held “deep” discussions about the drills with U.S. Defence Secretary James Mattis in a telephone conversation Thursday evening.Trump’s decision to suspend the exercises, coupled with the vague joint statement issued after his summit with Kim, have reinforced fears in South Korea that the North is attempting to take advantage of a U.S. president who appears to care less about the traditional alliance than his predecessors.Last year’s Ulchi Freedom Guardian went on for 11 days in August and involved about 17,500 U.S. troops. Also participating were troops from nations that contributed forces during the 1950-53 Korean War, including Australia, Britain, Canada and Colombia.The other major U.S. exercises with South Korea — Key Resolve and Foal Eagle — took place earlier this spring. They historically include live-fire drills with tanks, aircraft and warships and feature about 10,000 American and 200,000 Korean troops. The drills typically begin in March but were delayed a bit because of the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February.North Korea has always reacted to the Ulchi exercises with belligerence and often its own demonstrations of military capability.During last year’s Ulchi exercises, North Korea fired a powerful new intermediate-range missile over Japan in what its state media described as a “muscle-flexing” countermeasure to the drills.Military readiness and lethality have been key priorities for Mattis, so it is still not clear what, if any, smaller exercises may be conducted in the region with South Korea or if more desktop drills may be planned to compensate for the lack of larger, more coordinated events with various ships, aircraft and thousands of troops.Defence officials are also scrambling to pull together cost estimates for the various exercises with the South to inform Trump’s assertion that the suspension will save an enormous amount of money. Mattis’s office sent out a request to military commands last Wednesday seeking information on costs, but the Pentagon has yet to provide a public answer. "
77d978318d3503fc6485c138ae3f3aa2,"Taliban fighters patrol in the Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood in the city of Kabul, Afghanistan. The Taliban declared an ""amnesty"" across Afghanistan and urged women to join their government Tuesday, seeking to convince a wary population that they have changed a day after deadly chaos gripped the main airport as desperate crowds tried to flee the country.The Taliban have blown up the statue of a Shiite militia leader who fought against them during Afghanistan’s civil war in the 1990s, according to photos circulating on Wednesday, sowing further doubt about their claims to have become more moderate.The insurgents’ every action in their sudden sweep to power is being watched closely. They insist they have changed and won’t impose the same draconian restrictions they did when they last ruled Afghanistan, all but eliminating women’s rights, carrying out public executions and banning television and music.They also promised not to seek revenge against those who have opposed them.But many Afghans remain deeply skeptical, and thousands are racing to the airport and borders to flee the country. Many others are hiding inside their homes, fearful after prisons and armories were emptied during the insurgents’ blitz across the country.On Wednesday, groups of fighters carrying long guns patrolled a well-to-do neighborhood of the capital, Kabul, that is home to many embassies as well as mansions of the Afghan elite. The Taliban have promised to maintain security, but many Afghans are as afraid of them as they are of potential chaos.In a rare, early show of dissent, dozens of people gathered in the eastern city of Jalalabad and raised the Afghan national flag in an anti-Taliban demonstration, according to Salim Ahmad, a local resident. He said the Taliban fired in the air to disperse the crowd. There were no immediate reports of any casualties.The insurgents have raised their own flag — a white banner with Islamic inscriptions — in the territories they have seized.As Afghans and the international community look to see if the Taliban will make good on their promises, photos circulated on social media of the destroyed statue. It depicted Abdul Ali Mazari, a militia leader killed by the Taliban in 1996, when the Islamic militants seized power from rival warlords. Mazari was a champion of Afghanistan’s ethnic Hazara minority, Shiites who were persecuted under the Sunni Taliban’s earlier rule.The statue stood in the central Bamyan province, where the Taliban infamously blew up two massive 1,500-year-old statues of Buddha carved into a mountain in 2001, shortly before the U.S.-led invasion that drove them from power. The Taliban claimed the Buddhas violated Islam’s prohibition on idolatry.Another Taliban promise being closely watched is their vow to prevent Afghanistan from again being used as a base for planning terrorist attacks. That was enshrined in a 2020 peace deal with the Trump administration that paved the way for the drawdown of American troops, the last of whom are supposed to leave at the end of the month.When the Taliban were last in power they sheltered Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida while they planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. U.S. officials fear al-Qaida and other groups could reconstitute themselves in Afghanistan now that the Taliban are back in power.The Taliban have pledged to form an “inclusive, Islamic government” and have been holding talks with former President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, a senior official in the ousted government. Mohammad Yusof Saha, a spokesman for Karzai, said preliminary meetings with Taliban officials would facilitate eventual negotiations with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the top Taliban political leader.Photos circulating online Wednesday showed Karzai and Abdullah meeting with Anas Haqqani, a senior leader in a powerful Taliban faction. The U.S. branded the Haqqani network a terrorist group in 2012, and its involvement in a future government could trigger international sanctions.Amid the uncertainty, thousands of Afghans have tried to flee the country in recent days, and the U.S. and its allies have struggled to manage a chaotic withdrawal from the country. The Taliban took over the civilian side of the Kabul international airport on Tuesday and have used force to try to control the crowds.Hundreds of people were outside the airport early Wednesday. The Taliban demanded to see documents before allowing the rare passenger inside. Many of the people outside did not appear to have passports, and each time the gate opened even an inch, dozens tried to push through. The Taliban fired occasional warning shots to disperse them.The U.S. Embassy has meanwhile relocated to the military side of the airport, where it is coordinating the airlift of diplomats, foreigners and Afghans who worked with the Americans and now fear reprisal.The British government said it will welcome up to 5,000 Afghan refugees this year, and a total of 20,000 Afghans will be offered a way to settle in the U.K. in the coming years.ALSO READ | Taliban denied access to $9.5 billion of Afghan money“We owe a debt of gratitude to all those who have worked with us to make Afghanistan a better place over the last 20 years,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said late Tuesday.The head of Afghanistan’s Central Bank meanwhile said the country’s supply of physical U.S. dollars is “close to zero.” Afghanistan has some $9 billion in reserves, Ajmal Ahmady tweeted, but most is held outside the country, with some $7 billion held in U.S. Federal Reserve bonds, assets and gold.Ahmady said the country did not receive a planned cash shipment amid the Taliban offensive.“The next shipment never arrived,” he wrote. “Seems like our partners had good intelligence as to what was going to happen.”He said the lack of U.S. dollars will likely lead to a depreciation of the local currency, the afghani, hurting the country’s poor. Afghans have been lining up outside ATM machines for days, with many pulling out their life savings.Ahmady said the Taliban will struggle to access the country’s reserves because of international sanctions.The “Taliban won militarily — but now have to govern,” he wrote. “It is not easy.”ALSO READ | Will judge Taliban by actions it takes rather than its words: UK PM Boris Johnson   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_1577847092 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_g9q5vxba/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_g9q5vxba_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Taliban vow to honor women's rights but within Islamic law, says spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""277"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_1577847092 = ''; jwsetup_1577847092(); function jwsetup_1577847092() { jwvidplayer_1577847092 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_1577847092"").setup(jwconfig_1577847092); jwvidplayer_1577847092.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_1577847092, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_g9q5vxba\"", ns_st_pr=\""Taliban vow to honor women's rights but within Islamic law, says spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Taliban vow to honor women's rights but within Islamic law, says spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Taliban vow to honor women's rights but within Islamic law, says spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-08-17\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-08-17\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_g9q5vxba/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_1577847092.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_1577847092.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_1577847092.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_1577847092.stop(); jwvidplayer_1577847092.remove(); jwvidplayer_1577847092 = ''; jwsetup_1577847092(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_1577847092.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_1577847092.stop(); jwvidplayer_1577847092.remove(); jwvidplayer_1577847092 = ''; jwsetup_1577847092(); return; }); jwvidplayer_1577847092.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1577847092.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1577847092.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1577847092.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1577847092.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1577847092.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "
973c4f387dc9f48e1be58608101bc3d6,"A top official of American  defence intelligence has told US lawmakers that India is moving towards isolating Pakistan diplomatically and is considering punitive actions against Islamabad for its alleged support to cross border terrorism. ""India has sought and continues to move to isolate Pakistan diplomatically and is considering punitive options to raise the cost to Islamabad for its alleged support to cross- border terrorism,"" Lt Gen Vincent Stewart, Director, Defense Intelligence Agency told members of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee during a Congressional hearing on worldwide threats.His statement came a day after Indian Army launched ""punitive fire assaults"" on Pakistani positions across the Line of Control, inflicting some damage. India, he said, is modernising its military to better posture itself to defend New Delhis interests in the broader Indian Ocean region and reinforce its diplomatic and economic outreach across Asia.Bilateral relations between India and Pakistan worsened following several terrorist attacks in India, he said. ""Continued threat of high level terror attacks in India, violence in Kashmir and bilateral diplomatic recriminations will further strain India-Pakistan ties in 2017,"" he said.Following a terrorist attack on an Army base Kashmir last September, New Delhi conducted a highly publicised operation against militants across the Line of Control, he added.""In 2016, Indian and Pakistani forces exchanged some of the heaviest fire in years along the Line of Control in Kashmir, and each expelled a number of the other?s diplomats amid growing tension,"" Stewart said.He also told lawmakers that in 2017, Islamabad is likely to slowly shift from traditional counterinsurgency operations along Pakistans western border to more counter terrorism and paramilitary operations throughout the country, which have had some success in reducing violence from militant, sectarian, terrorist, and separatist groups.""Anti-Pakistan groups probably will respond to this sustained pressure by focusing their efforts against soft targets,"" he said.Noting that Pakistans nuclear stockpile continues to grow, Stewart said the US is concerned that this growth, as well as an evolving doctrine and inherent security issues associated with Pakistans developing tactical  nuclear weapons, presents an enduring risk.""Islamabad is taking steps to improve its nuclear security and is aware of the extremist threat to its program,"" Stewart said.Observing that China has long identified the protection of its sovereignty and territorial integrity as a ""core interest,"" he said in the South China Sea, China has embarked on a multi year, whole-of-government approach to securing sovereignty, principally through maritime law enforcement presence and military patrols.In 2016, China rejected the international arbitration ruling on its excessive South China Sea claims, built infrastructure at its man made outposts on the Spratly Islands, and for the first time, landed civilian aircraft on its airfields at Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef, and Mischief Reef.""China will be able to use its reclaimed features as persistent civil-military bases, which will enhance its presence and its ability to control the features and nearby maritime space. Beijing recognises the need to defend these outposts and is prepared to respond to any military operations near them,"" he told the lawmakers. Stewart said a key component of PLA strategy in a regional contingency is planning for potential US intervention.The PLA Rocket Force has given priority to developing and deploying regional ballistic and cruise missiles to expand its conventional strike capabilities against US forces and bases throughout the region.""In addition to the Rocket Forces fielding of an anti ship ballistic missile, China is fielding an intermediate range ballistic missile capable of conducting conventional and nuclear strikes against ground targets in the Asia-Pacific region as far away as Guam,"" he said.(With PTI inputs)"

a2d165e9494cabdedf1bd4ae1874aa76,"Trump looking at exempting Apple from China tariffs US President Donald Trump who visited Apple's Austin-based Mac Pro plant has said the government is ""looking at"" whether Apple should be exempt from China tariffs. ""When you build in the United States, you don't have to worry about tariffs,"" he said, accompanied by CEO Tim Cook as he toured the Mac Pro computer manufacturing facility on Wednesday.""We're looking at that,"" he said in footage streamed by Fox News. Trump also cited South Korean major Samsung as a reason behind his decision to look into tariffs. ""The problem we have is you have Samsung, it's a great company, but it's a competitor of Apple. And it's not fair because we have a trade deal, we made a great trade deal with South Korea. But we have to treat Apple in a somewhat similar basis as we treat Samsung,"" Trump was quoted as saying.In August, Trump praised Cook for ""making a good case"" that tariffs on China will help Samsung gain more as it is based in South Korea and does not need to pay any tariffs. Cook took Trump to various locations at the plant, showcasing how Mac Pro desktops are being manufactured.A worker explained part of the assembly process, and showed the bottom of a computer with the inscription: ""Assembled in the USA"". ""That's what we want,"" Trump was quoted as saying.The US President later tweeted, taking a jibe at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in his usual style: ""Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America. Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn't care about American Workers!."" Before his visit, Apple announced it has started construction of a new $1 billion, 133-acre campus and production of the all-new Mac Pro that it aims to ship to customers starting in December.The new campus, near the already-running Mac Pro production facility, will initially house 5,000 employees, with the capacity to grow to 15,000, and is expected to open in 2022. Mac Pro units are now in production in Austin and will soon ship to customers across the Americas.Apple said it is on track to contribute $350 billion to the US economy between 2018 and 2023, and during that time, will hire an additional 20,000 employees in cities across the country. The current 244,000-square-foot Mac Pro facility employs more than 500 people in a range of roles, including electrical engineers and electronics assemblers, who build each unique unit to customers' specifications.Apple and its manufacturing partners invested over $200 million in the Mac Pro facility in Austin, building out the complex assembly line where the Mac Pro is produced.ALSO READ | India-UK experts begin largest study on babies with brain injury in IndiaALSO READ | UN chief spotlights partnership to fight terrorism"

17573fadda4d74c22769b88fd8472357,"Hong Kong Virologist, who fled to US, accuses China of covering-up COVID-19 spread A Hong Kong-based virologist has claimed that China knew about the deadly novel coronavirus well before it claimed it did. In an interview to US-based Fox News published on Friday, Dr Li-Meng Yan, who has specialised in virology and immunology at Hong Kong School of Public Health, claimed Chinese authorities knew about the deadly virus in December last year, but hushed it up. She said that China likely had an obligation to tell the world, given their status as a World Health Organisation (WHO) reference laboratory specialising in influenza viruses and pandemics, especially as the virus began spreading in the early days of 2020.She added that her supervisors, renowned as some of the top experts in the field, also ignored research she was doing at the onset of the pandemic that she believes could have saved lives.Yan, who said she was one of the first scientists in the world to study COVID-19, was allegedly asked by her supervisor at the University/WHO reference lab, Dr Leo Poon, last year to look into the odd cluster of SARS-like cases coming out of mainland China at the end of December 2019.""The Chinese government refused to let overseas experts, including ones in Hong Kong to do research in China,"" she said. Yan said very soon she and her colleagues across China discussed the peculiar virus but that she soon noted a sharp shift in tone. Doctors and researchers who had been openly discussing the virus suddenly clammed up. Those from the city of Wuhan--which later would become the hub of the outbreak -- went silent and others were warned not to ask them details.The doctors said, ominously, ""We cannot talk about it, but we need to wear masks,'"" Yan said. The numbers of human-to-human transmission cases then began to grow exponentially, according to her sources.Yan made the decision to leave. She packed her bags, sneaked past the censors and video cameras on campus, and boarded a Cathay Pacific flight to the United States, on April 28. She had her passport and her purse and was about to leave all of her loved ones behind. If she was caught, she knew she could be thrown in jail -- or, worse, rendered one of the ""disappeared"".Yan believes her life is still in danger. She fears she can never go back to her home and lives with the hard truth that she will likely never see her friends or family there again. Still, she said, the risk is worth it. ""The reason I came to the US is because I deliver the message of the truth of COVID,"" she told Fox News from an undisclosed location. She added that if she tried to tell her story in China, she ""will be disappeared and Killed"".Yan, now in hiding, claims that the government in the country where she was born is trying to shred her reputation and accuses""government goons"" of choreographing a cyber-attack against her in hopes of keeping her quiet.She divulged to the media that the Hong Kong government swarmed her hometown of Qingdao and that agents ripped apart her tiny apartment and questioned her parents. When she contacted her parents, they pleaded with her to come home, and told her that she did not know what she was talking about, and begged her to give up the fight.   Meanwhile, the University of Hong Kong has also taken down her page and apparently revoked access to her online portals and e-mails, even after she says that she was on an approved annual leave.In a statement to Fox News, a school spokesperson said that Yan is not currently an employee. "

Prime Minister Khan in April 2017 alleged that Shahbaz offered him USD 61 million through a “common friend” to withdraw the Panama Papers case in the Supreme Court against 70-year-old former prime minister and his elder brother Nawaz Sharif.Sharif, who is currently in London for treatment, is the supremo of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). He was disqualified as prime minister in 2017 by the Supreme Court in 2017 in the Panama Papers case.Three corruption cases - Avenfield properties, Flagship investment and Al-Azizia steel mills - were registered against the Sharif family by the anti-graft body in 2017 following a judgment by the Supreme Court that disqualified him.However, Khan did not name the person who offered him USD 61 million on behalf of the Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz.Lahore's Additional District and Sessions Court on Friday took up Shahbaz’s application for early hearing on June 10 in which he pleaded that (Prime Minister) Khan failed to file a written reply for the last three years causing no substantial proceedings in the case.“In total 60 hearings in this case, Khan’s lawyer sought adjournment on 33 occasions. In the last hearing, the court was told that lead counsel advisor to Khan, Babar Awan could not travel from Islamabad to Lahore due to COVID-19 and the court adjourned hearing for June 22,” a counsel for Shahbaz told the court.Under the law, he said Awan cannot appear before the court to defend PM Khan since he has become his advisor.In his petition, Shahbaz requested the court to issue a decree for recovery of USD 61 million as compensation for the publication of defamatory content in his favour for causing great damage to his reputation in the public.After hearing the arguments, Additional District & Sessions Judge Sohail Anjum issued notice to Prime Minister Khan for June 10 to submit a written reply.Talking to the media after the court issued notice to Prime Minister Khan, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Auranzeb said: “Imran will no longer qualify on Article 62, 63 of the Constitution if he fails to submit a response in the Rs10bn defamation case. I challenge Imran Khan to answer in court over his allegation of Rs10bn hush money offered by Shehbaz Sharif to him.”She said if on Jun 10 Imran fails to submit an answer in the court he will be “officially stamped” as a ""liar"" and will no longer be morally eligible to hold the office of a member of the National Assembly and the Prime Minister of Pakistan.“Does a liar, incompetent and unqualified person deserve to be the leader of the Pakistani nation,” she asked.Auranzeb further said Imran has been an absconder in this case for the past three years, and has delayed proceedings 33 times.“Similarly, for the last six years he had been an absconder from the foreign funding case and for the past two years over the 23 secret accounts case,” she lamented."

At least a dozen people were killed in Chicago over the Fourth of July weekend, police said. Scores of people were shot and wounded. (Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune via AP)At least 13 people, including a 7-year-old girl at a family party and a teenage boy, were killed in Chicago over the Fourth of July weekend, police said. At least 59 others were shot and wounded.In one shooting, just before midnight Saturday, four males opened fire on a large gathering in the street in the Englewood neighborhood, police spokesman Tom Ahern said. Two males died at the scene and two more, including a 14-year-old boy, died at a hospital, Ahern said.Four others were injured; one was in critical condition and the other three were in fair condition, Ahern said. The four attackers fled the scene. No one was arrested.The 7-year-old girl was fatally shot in the head while standing on the sidewalk at her grandmother’s house during a Fourth of July party around 7 p.m. in the Austin neighborhood, police said.Suspects got out of a car and began shooting, police said. No one has been arrested.“Tonight, a 7-year-old girl in Austin joined a list of teenagers and children whose hopes and dreams were ended by the barrel of a gun,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said on Twitter late Saturday.The mayor added: “As a city, we must wrap our arms around our youth so they understand there’s a future for them that isn’t wrapped up in gun violence.”A 32-year-old man was injured in the shooting and was in fair condition.The Chicago Sun-Times, citing police, said that seven of those injured in shootings were minors.The shootings this weekend that killed young people followed tragedy the weekend before when victims included a 1-year-old boy riding in a car with his mother and a 10-year-old girl who was inside her home when a bullet fired a block away pierced a window and struck her in the head as she sat on a couch.In response to violence that has occurred since Memorial Day weekend, police said they would have 1,200 extra officers on the streets for this holiday weekend."

Travel restrictions on several other countries including China and Iran remain in place.In an executive order, Trump said he is removing the restrictions applicable to the European Union, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and Brazil, while leaving in place the restrictions applicable to China and Iran.A decision in this regard, he said, is being taken after the January 12 directive of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requiring proof of a negative COVID-19 test or documentation of having recovered from COVID-19 for all air passengers arriving from a foreign country to the United States.Trump said that European Union, Britain, Ireland and Brazil will cooperate with the US in the implementation of CDC's January 12, 2021, order and that tests administered there will yield accurate results.However, the same cannot be said of China and Iran. “Those jurisdictions' responses to the pandemic, their lack of transparency, and their lack of cooperation with the United States thus far in combatting the pandemic, cast doubt on their cooperation in implementing CDC's January 12, 2021, order,” Trump said.The previous travel restrictions were announced on March 14 and May 24 of last year.ALSO READ | Trump to leave Washington on morning of Biden’s inauguration"

The Federal Investigation Agency's special court in 2018 convicted Saadat Amin, 45, under Section 22 of Prevention of Electronic Crime Act 2016 and imposed Rs 1.2m fine on him.According to the FIA, it was the first-ever conviction in any child pornography scam in Pakistan.The Lahore High Court on Thursday suspended Amin's sentence and ordered his release on bail.In an appeal before the court, Amin’s counsel advocate Rana Nadeem Ahmad argued that the investigation held by the FIA was “faulty” as it failed to arrest or investigate the alleged foreign agent in Norway and present “the victim children” before the court."
44f8afc96d71152765957f982fc3a151,"Hope of COVID-19 vaccine deployment in UK by New Year: ReportOne of the UK's senior-most medical chiefs has indicated that a vaccine against COVID-19 could be ready to be deployed by the start of the New Year, according to a media report on Sunday.Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer and one of the government’s advisers on the coronavirus pandemic, has reportedly told members of Parliament (MPs) that the vaccine created at Oxford University and being manufactured by AstraZeneca could be ready for rollout soon after Christmas in December.In India, the vaccine has a Serum Institute of India tie-up as it undergoes trials.""We aren’t light years away from it. It isn’t a totally unrealistic suggestion that we could deploy a vaccine soon after Christmas. That would have a significant impact on hospital admissions and deaths,"" The Sunday Times’ quoted Van Tam as telling the MPs during a briefing last week.An MP who attended another briefing with Van-Tam told the newspaper that the medic was ""very bullish about the third stage AstraZeneca results, which he expects between the end of this month and the end of next"".""Van-Tam expects it to protect the elderly and vulnerable. He gave us to understand that it stopped the virus ‘shedding’ in the young. He said he would expect vaccination to start in January,"" the MP was quoted as saying.It comes as the UK government introduced new laws on Friday that would allow larger numbers of healthcare workers to administer flu and potential COVID-19 vaccines.""COVID-19 vaccines are being developed at speed which, if successful, will save lives,"" said Van-Tam, in reference to the new rules.""All vaccines must undergo three stages of clinical trials and be assessed for safety and effectiveness by the regulator before they are given to patients. The measures outlined today aim to improve access and strengthen existing safeguards protecting patients,” he said.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that the new measures would increase access to vaccines against potentially killer diseases and also support the government’s plans for the roll-out of a potential COVID-19 vaccine that is proven to be safe and effective through robust clinical trials and approved for use by the regulator.""The National Health Service (NHS) has vast experience in vaccinating millions of people against diseases every year,"" said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.""These legal changes will help us in doing everything we can to make sure we are ready to roll out a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it has passed clinical trials and undergone rigorous checks by the regulator,"" he said.The aim is to increase the number of fully trained and experienced healthcare professionals to administer COVID-19 and flu vaccines under NHS and local authority occupational health schemes, as well as enable an expanded workforce that can administer these vaccinations to the public.This will make it easier and quicker for patients and healthcare workers to access the vaccines they need, protecting them against fatal diseases, the DHSC said.Therefore, if a vaccine is developed before 2021, the changes to the Human Medicine Regulations will bolster existing powers that enable the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to authorise temporary supply for any treatment or vaccine needed to respond to a public health need.This means that if a vaccine has been found to meet the safety, quality and effectiveness standards by the MHRA, then vaccinations can begin without needing to wait for the European Medicines Agency who – up until the end of the transition period on December 31 this year – would have been the only body able to grant a licence.Dr Christian Schneider, Interim Chief Scientific Officer at the MHRA, said: ""No vaccine will be deployed unless stringent standards have been met through a comprehensive clinical trial programme.""The preferred route to enable deployment of any new vaccine remains through the usual product licensing processes. But reinforced safeguards are now in place to strengthen the regulatory regime and our ability to protect public health, should temporary authorisations be necessary.""The first vaccines are set to be given to the elderly and vulnerable, followed by vaccination of others most at risk. Any population-wide roll-out is expected to be a much longer-term process."
feca6fc7ca5e729ca6be21362aa1eb9f,"Soleimani contributed to terror plots in Delhi: TrumpUS President Donald Trump has accused slain Iran Revolutionary Guards Commander General Qasem Soleimani of contributing to terror plots in New Delhi and London. After the killing of the Iranian military leader, Trump addressed the media at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Flordia's Palm Beach, to announce that Soleimani's 'reign of terror' is over. While addressing the media, the US President said, ""Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London. Soleimani has been perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the Middle East for the last 20 years. What the United States did yesterday should have been done long ago. A lot of lives would have been saved. Speaking about the missile strike he ordered to kill Soleimani, he said, ""Today we remember and honour the victims of Soleimani's many atrocities and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over.""However, he did not specify the plots in India. There is a speculation that he may have been referring to a 2012 bombing of Israeli defence attache's wife Tal Yehoshua Koren's car in India. On February 2012, Israeli Embassy worker and wife of the security attache Alon Yehoshua, Koren was thrown from the car by the blast in New Delhi. She was injured and underwent surgery after the attack. Shrapnel were removed from her spinal cord, liver, and lungs, after undergoing hours of surgery in Primus Hospital. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran for plotting this attack and for a thwarted bombing in Tbilisi, Georgia. However, the New Delhi case not been resolved so far and a conclusive link to Iran has not been made by India.News reports at that time said that the attack was carried out by Iran in retaliation for the killing of Iranian nuclear scientist Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan in Teheran using a bomb with a magnet attached to his car, allegedly by Israelis.An Indian journalist, Syed Mohammad Ahmad Kazmi, was arrested on March 6 that year and accused of being a part of a conspiracy to carry out the attack and held under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.He was released on bail by the Supreme Court in October on the condition that he does not go abroad.According to news reports at that time, Delhi police alleged that he had carried out reconnaissance for the Iranians who carried out the attack.The five persons who carried out the attacks were Iranian members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard who had visited Delhi, police were quoted as saying. They were not arrested although police identified them.An Iranian major general, Soleimani was the leader of the Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards. But his name did not figure in the reports at that time on the Indian attack.In his address on the killing of Soleimani in Iraq on Thursday, Trump said on Friday, ""Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him.""He listed several alleged attacks directed by Soleimani and carried out by the Quds Force and allied militias.""For years, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its ruthless Quds Force -- under Soleimani's leadership -- has targeted, injured, and murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen,"" Trump said.He blamed Soleimani fro the recent attacks on US targets in Iraq, including rocket strikes that killed an American and injured four American servicemen, as well as the assault on the US embassy in Baghdad earlier this week.(With inputs from IANS)ALSO READ | Iranian general Soleimani's killing was to stop war, not start one: Donald TrumpALSO READ | US carries out second air raid in Iraq, kills 6 PMF militiaVideo | Iran commander Qasem Soleimani killed in Baghdad airport attack   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

c41b7b040354465db790fc5ebec33e0f,"US President Donald TrumpPresident Donald Trump on Thursday put off a final decision on possible military strikes against Syria after tweeting earlier that they could happen “very soon or not so soon at all.” The White House said he would consult further with allies.Defence Secretary Jim Mattis warned such an attack carried the risk of spinning out of control, suggesting caution ahead of a decision on how to respond to an attack against civilians last weekend that U.S. officials are increasingly certain involved the use of banned chemical weapons. British officials said up to 75 people were killed.Related Stories FBI raids Donald Trump lawyer's office, seizes porn star Stormy Daniels documentsTrump's top homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert resignsDonald Trump cancels Latin America trip to focus on SyriaXi Jinping vs Donald Trump: Who has the better hand in potential trade war?The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a brief statement after Mr. Trump met with Mr. Mattis and other members of his National Security Council- “No final decision has been made. We are continuing to assess intelligence and are engaged in conversations with our partners and allies.”Ms. Sanders said Mr. Trump would speak later with French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May.‘No change in U.S. Policy’Although Mr. Mattis noted that military action carried risks, he also emphasised that Syrian use of chemical weapons should not be tolerated. And he insisted it remains U.S. policy not to be involved directly in Syria’s civil war.“Our strategy remains the same as a year ago,” he said. “It is to drive this to a U.N.-brokered peace but, at the same time, keep our foot on the neck of ISIS until we suffocate it,” referring to the Islamic State extremist group.Mr. Mattis’ remarks at a House Armed Services Committee hearing followed a series of Trump tweets this week that initially indicated he was committed to bombing Syria but later suggested he was awaiting further advice and assessment. Trump wrote in a Thursday morning tweet that an attack could happen “very soon or not so soon at all.”Later Thursday he was noncommittal. “We’re looking very, very seriously, very closely at the whole situation,” he told reporters.Mr. Mattis said options would be discussed with Mr.Trump at a meeting of his National Security Council on Thursday afternoon. That meant airstrikes, possibly in tandem with France and other allies that have expressed outrage at the alleged Syrian chemical attack, could be launched within hours of a presidential decision.The U.S., France and Britain have been in extensive consultations about launching a military strike as early as the end of this week, U.S. officials have said. A joint military operation, possibly with France rather than the U.S. in the lead, could send a message of international unity about enforcing the prohibitions on chemical weapons.Macron said Thursday that France has proof that the Syrian government launched chlorine gas attacks and said France would not tolerate “regimes that think everything is permitted.”After Ms. May met with her Cabinet, a spokesperson issued a statement saying it is highly likely that Syria’s President Bashar Assad was responsible for Saturday’s attack that killed dozens outside Damascus. The Cabinet agreed on the need to “take action” to deter further chemical weapons use by Assad, but added that May would continue to consult with allies to coordinate an international response.‘Syria responsible for gas attack’Mr. Mattis said that although the United States has no hard proof, he believes the Syrian government was responsible for Saturday’s attack. Initial reports indicated the use of chlorine gas, possibly in addition to the nerve agent Sarin. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told NBC News on Thursday the administration has “enough proof” of the chemical attack but was still considering its response.The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, based in the Netherlands, announced it was sending a fact-finding team to the site of the attack outside Damascus, and it was due to arrive Saturday. It was not clear whether the presence of the investigators could affect the timing of any U.S. military action.At the House hearing, Democrats grilled Mattis on the wisdom and legality of Trump ordering an attack on Syria without explicit authorization from Congress. Mattis argued it would be justified as an act of self-defense, with 2,000 U.S. ground troops in Syria; he insisted he could not talk about military plans because an attack “is not yet in the offing.”Mr. Mattis said he personally believes Syria is guilty of an “inexcusable” use of chemical weapons, while noting that the international fact-finding team would likely fall short of determining who was responsible.Asked about the risks of U.S. military retaliation, Mattis cited two concerns, starting with avoiding civilian casualties.“On a strategic level, it’s how do we keep this from escalating out of control, if you get my drift on that,” he said.Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he sees no legal justification for a U.S. strike in Syria, absent explicit authorization by Congress. More broadly, he doubted the wisdom of bombing.“Until we have a more long-term strategy, until we have some idea where we’re going in Syria and the Middle East, it seems unwise, to me, to start launching missiles,” said Smith, D-Wash. “We need to know where that’s going, what the purpose of it is before we take that act.”At stake in Syria is the potential for confrontation, if not outright conflict, between the U.S. and Russia, former Cold War foes whose relations have deteriorated in recent years over Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine, its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and its support for Syrian President Bashar Assad.Russian lawmakers have warned the United States that Moscow would view an airstrike on Syria as a war crime and that it could trigger a direct U.S-Russian military clash. Russia’s ambassador to Lebanon said any missiles fired at Syria would be shot down and the launching sites targeted a stark warning of a potential major confrontation.At the House hearing, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, disputed Trump’s legal authority to act without congressional authority and suggested a U.S. strike would lead to war with Russia.“I’m not ready to speculate that that would happen,” Mr. Mattis said."

The reporters were covering a protest by women in Kabul demanding an end to Taliban violation of women and girls' rights.Etilaat-e-Roz reported that Taliban authorities took the two men to a police station in Kabul, placed them in separate cells, and severely beat them with cables. Both men were released the next day after which they received treatment at a hospital for the injuries they suffered on their backs and faces.""Taliban authorities claimed that they would allow the media to function so long as they ‘respect Islamic values', but they are increasingly preventing journalists from reporting on demonstrations,"" said Patricia Gossman, Associate Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, adding: ""The Taliban need to ensure that all journalists are able to carry out their work without abusive restrictions or fear of retribution.""The Taliban authorities also detained a Tolo News photojournalist, Wahid Ahmadi, on September 7, and released him the same day. They confiscated his camera and prevented other journalists from filming the protest.Since early September, Afghan women and girls in several cities have been holding protests against Taliban's violation of women and girls' rights, including denial of their right to education and access to employment.Women have spearheaded these protests, but increasingly men have also joined them. On September 7, hundreds of protesters – both women and men – marched through Kabul chanting slogans critical of the Taliban.Taliban security forces have disrupted most of these recent demonstrations by beating up the protesters, confiscating and damaging cameras, and by threatening the reporters.On September 7, the Taliban had announced that protests, in general, are illegal unless approved from beforehand.However, some journalists covering the protests have said that Taliban officials have told them that reporting on protests is also illegal now.Taliban commanders and fighters have for long engaged in a pattern of threats, intimidation and violence against members of the media, and have been responsible for targeted killings of journalists, the Human Rights Watch said.International human rights law prohibits arbitrary restrictions on the rights to freedom of speech and expression, including detaining journalists and banning media outlets.""Taliban authorities are obligated under international law to respect and uphold everyone's right to peaceful protests and to respect the rights of women and girls,"" Gossman said, adding: ""The concerned governments should press the Taliban to protect free expression and peaceful assembly."""

Jindal had the backing of some important Indian officials for the meeting to defuse ongoing tension between the two countries, the report said. India-Pak ties are strained over a series of cross-border terror attacks in India and over the death sentence to former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav. New Delhi has denied Pakistan's allegations of spying charges against Jadhav and has maintained that he was kidnapped by Pakistani intelligence agencies from Iran. The report quoting a ruling PML-N leader said Sharif was tight-lipped on his meeting with Jindal. However, the only detail of the meeting he shared with his aides was that Jindal was making efforts to defuse tension between India and Pakistan. It said the military leadership also took its officers into confidence on the meeting. Gen Bajwa told his officers that the meeting was a part of a back-channel diplomacy. The Sharif-Jindal meeting had triggered intense speculation with several politicians and analysts suggesting it could be the precursor to a possible meeting between the two premiers in the near future. Pakistan prime minister's adviser on foreign affairs Adviser Aziz told reporters yesterday that if India shows interest, Pakistan will look into the possibility of a meeting between Sharif and Modi on the sidelines of the SCO summit on June 8-9 at Astana in Kazakhstan.Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had moved a resolution in the Punjab Assembly expressing concern over the ""secret"" meeting. It had also alleged that Jindal conveyed Modi's ""message"" to Sharif on the death penalty to Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav on spying charges. Jindal is said to be the man who had arranged a meeting between Modi and Sharif in Lahore on December 25 in 2015 on Sharif's birthday and the day when Sharif's granddaughter Mehr-un-Nisa was married. (With PTI inputs)"

They have grown increasingly concerned about the possibility such groups could stream into Washington and spark violent confrontations, a law enforcement official said.Even in the hours before the event, federal agents were monitoring “concerning online chatter,” which included an array of threats against elected officials and discussions about ways to infiltrate the inauguration, the official said.And 12 National Guard members were removed from the security operation after vetting by the FBI, including two who had made extremist statements in posts or texts about Wednesday’s event. Pentagon officials wouldn’t give details on the statements.Two other U.S. officials told The Associated Press that all 12 were found to have ties with right-wing militia groups or to have posted extremist views online. The officials, a senior intelligence official and an Army official briefed on the matter, did not say which fringe groups the Guard members belonged to or what unit they served in. The officials told the AP they had all been removed because of “security liabilities.”The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, confirmed that Guard members had been removed and sent home but said only two cases were related to inappropriate comments or texts related to the inauguration. He said the other 10 cases were for potential issues that may involve previous criminal behavior or activities but were not directly related to the inaugural event.Their removal from the massive security presence at the nation’s capital came amid worries from U.S. defense officials about a potential insider attack or other threat from service members following the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 by Trump supporters. The FBI has been working to vet all 25,000 National Guard in town. Officials have said the Pentagon has found no intelligence so far that would indicate an insider threat.But the FBI has also warned law enforcement officials about the possibility that right-wing fringe groups could pose as members of the National Guard, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the matter. Over the summer, a man carrying a handgun and an assault rifle was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with impersonating a National Guard member during a protest. Actual Guardsmen confronted him when they noticed things out of place on his uniform.Investigators in Washington are particularly worried that members of right-wing extremist groups and militias, like the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, could descend on Washington to spark violence, the law enforcement officials said. Some of the extremist groups are known to recruit former military personnel and train extensively and have frequented anti-government and political protests.That concern intensified significantly after investigators identified members of right-wing extremist groups participating in the Capitol riot.The nation’s capital has been on edge since the deadly insurrection. A fire in a homeless camp roughly a mile from the Capitol complex prompted an evacuation Monday during a rehearsal for the inauguration. The arrests of two people with guns who entered the checkpoints set off concerns, though the arrests had no apparent connection to the inauguration.Federal law enforcement officials have also been wary of increased surveillance of military and law enforcement checkpoints and other positions. Some National Guard troops have reported people taking pictures and recording them, said the law enforcement officials, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing security matters.In a related problem, the Secret Service issued a bulletin over the weekend about what it sees as an “uptick” in National Guard troops posting pictures and details of their own operations online.The AP obtained the message sent to all National Guard troops coming to Washington. The bulletin read, “No service members should be posting locations, pictures or descriptions online regarding current operations or the sensitive sites they are protecting” and urged them to stop immediately.Asked about the bulletin, a spokesperson for the Secret Service said the agency “does not comment on matters of protective intelligence.”Neither Hokanson nor Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman would provide details on the comments or texts made by the two Guard members. Speaking at a Pentagon news conference, Hokanson said one was identified by his chain of command and the other was identified through an anonymous tip.“Much of the information,” Hoffman said, “is unrelated to the events taking place at the Capitol or to the concerns that many people have noted on extremism. These are vetting efforts that identify any questionable behavior in the past or any potential link to questionable behavior, not just related to extremism.”Hoffman said officials aren’t asking questions right now of those who were flagged. But later, he said, “we will address them, whether it’s through law enforcement, if necessary, or through their own chain of command.”"

His extradition trial is scheduled for May 11 and is expected to last over five days.Deputy Chief Magistrate Tan Ikram who was the judge on Thursday, asked if there are any other issues to be discussed now. Modi, wearing black, light grey and white sweat shirt and grey bottom, said no.The 48-year-old had moved yet another bail application last November with an ""unprecedented"" house arrest guarantee, akin to those imposed on terrorist suspects, as well as citing mental health issues from being behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest in March.But the bail plea was turned down by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot over continued fears of witness intimidation and failure to surrender before the court for his extradition trial in May 2020.""The past is a prediction of what might happen in the future,"" Judge Arbuthnot had said at the time. The UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which represents the Indian government in the extradition proceedings, said there is no further prospect of an appeal for bail in a higher court as the UK High Court has already turned down Modi’s plea earlier this year.“You only get to go once and can’t keep appealing over and over,” a CPS spokesperson had said. Meanwhile, Modi must appear for ""call-over"" hearings at Westminster Magistrates' Court until the case management hearings for his extradition trial kick in over the coming weeks.The diamond merchant denies the charges of fraud and money laundering and his defence team, led by barrister Hugo Keith, has claimed that the Indian government has wrongly ""blackened"" Modi's name as a ""world-class schemer"".Modi has been behind bars at Wandsworth, one of England's most overcrowded prisons, since his arrest on March 19 on an extradition warrant executed by the Scotland Yard on charges brought by the Indian government.During subsequent hearings, the UK court has been told that Modi was the ""principal beneficiary"" of the fraudulent issuance of letters of undertaking (LoUs) as part of a conspiracy to defraud PNB and then laundering the proceeds of crime. "

Nandy has become the fourth Labour hopeful to throw her hat in the ring after Clive Lewis, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry.The Member of Parliament for Wigan said she believed the party had to change to regain the trust of voters after suffering the huge loss. Nandy, who served as the shadow Energy Secretary from 2015 to 2016, said she was ""heartbroken"" to see so many working-class constituencies had chosen the Conservatives over Labour at the last general election.In a stark warning to party members, Nandy, who has championed the needs of Britain's towns, said ""unless we change course, we will become irrelevant"". She said the drubbing at the hands of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party, including losing swathes of seats in the northern heartlands, was a ""long time coming.""Nandy argued that the next leader should come from those areas which feel neglected and are turning away from the party, with a deep understanding of the problems of the regions face.""It has been 14 years since Labour last won power and I want you to know I have listened and I understand that we have one chance to win back the trust of people of Wigan, Workington and Wrexham. Without what we were once our labour heartlands we will never win power in Westminster and help to build the country we know we can be.""I wanted to tell you first that I'm standing to be leader of the Labour Party because after a decade of having the privilege to represent you, I have a deeper understanding of what has gone awry in our discredited political system,"" she said. Nandy said the next Labour leader will have to be up for a scrap - willing to run to the places ""we are loathed, take the anger on the chin, make and win argument"".She said she was ""determined to defeat Boris Johnson in order to lead the compassionate, radical, dynamic government I firmly believe you want and you deserve"". Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) will set out a timetable on Monday for the leadership campaign. It is thought it will be completed by the end of March. Corbyn is standing down as leader following the party's crushing election defeat. "

On Friday, Singapore reported 768 new cases of coronavirus. The Health Ministry said the vast majority of the 753 new cases reported on Saturday are work permit holders (foreigners) residing in worker dormitories.Nine cases are Singapore citizens or permanent residents (foreigners).As of Friday, 19,232 of the 323,000 foreign workers living in dormitories, or nearly six per cent, have tested positive for COVID-19, reported The Straits Times.Singapore had placed 18,402 coronavirus patients in isolation while 1,245 are hospitalised by Friday, according to a data from the Health Ministry.The Ministry said 1,245 cases were still in hospital while 20 people have died of the disease.Singapore currently has the highest number of coronavirus cases in South-east Asia and saw a surge in cases in last few weeks, especially after the medical testing of foreign workers, many of them Indians, living in dormitories.After a drop in COVID-19 cases in the local community, Singapore eased some restrictions from May 5, including allowing residents to exercise in the common areas of strata-titled residential buildings such as private condominiums, according to a report by Channel News Asia.Traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture was also allowed to resume for pain management, said the report.Meanwhile, some businesses, including hairdressers and home-based food businesses, will also be allowed to resume operations from May 12, with a gradual resumption of selected activities and services over a few weeks, authorities had announced recently.As part of the gradual easing of ‘circuit breaker’ measures, schools will start to bring back students in small groups for face-to-face lessons from May 19, with priority given to graduating cohorts.But National Development Minister Lawrence Wong cautioned in a press conference on Friday that Singaporeans should not rush to go out when businesses reopen on May 12.“We are making progress because of the circuit breaker and we should continue to do our part to comply with the measures for the rest of the circuit breaker period. We should remain vigilant and not take any chances,” he said.ALSO READ | 6-week-old baby becomes UK's youngest COVID-19 victimALSO READ | UK to bring in 14-day quarantine for air passengers amid coronavirus pandemic"
85a90bdee613311f0c20c3571d8e43bf,"Stampede at funeral of Iran General Qassem Soleimani, 35 killed so farA stampede erupted on Tuesday at a funeral procession for a top Iranian general killed in a U.S. airstrike last week, killing 35 people and injuring 48 others, state television reported.According to the report, the stampede took place in Kerman, the hometown of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, as the procession got underway. Initial videos posted online showed people lying lifeless on a road, others shouting and trying to help them.Iranian state TV gave the casualty toll in its online report, without saying where it obtained the information. Pirhossein Koulivand, the head of Iran’s emergency medical services, earlier spoke by telephone to state TV and confirmed the stampede took place.“Unfortunately as a result of the stampede, some of our compatriots have been injured and some have been killed during the funeral processions,” he said.A procession in Tehran on Monday drew over 1 million people in the Iranian capital, crowding both main thoroughfares and side streets in Tehran.Soleimani’s death has sparked calls across Iran for revenge against Americafor a slaying that’s drastically raised tensions across the Middle East.Early Tuesday, the leader of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard threatened to “set ablaze” places supported by the United States over the killing of a top Iranian general in a U.S. airstrike last week, sparking cries from the crowd of supporters of “Death to Israel!” Hossein Salami made the pledge before a crowd of thousands gathered in a central square in Kerman before a casket carrying Soleimani’s remains.The outpouring of grief was an unprecedented honor for a man viewed by Iranians as a national hero for his work leading the Guard’s expeditionary Quds Force. The U.S. blames him for the killing of American troops in Iraq and accused him of plotting new attacks just before his death Friday in a drone strike near Baghdad’s airport. Soleimani also led forces in Syria backing President Bashar Assad in a long war, and he also served as the point man for Iranian proxies in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.His slaying already has pushed Tehran to abandon the remaining limits of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers as his successor and others vow to take revenge. In Baghdad, the parliament has called for the expulsion of all American troops from Iraqi soil, something analysts fear could allow Islamic State militants to mount a comeback.Speaking in Kerman, Salami praised Soleimani’s exploits, describing him as essential to backing Palestinian groups, Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria. As a martyr, Soleimani represented an even greater threat to Iran’s enemies, Salami said.“We will take revenge. We will set ablaze where they like,” Salami said, drawing the cries of “Death to Israel!”Israel is a longtime regional foe of Iran.According to a report on Tuesday by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, Iran has worked up 13 sets of plans for revenge for Soleimani’s killing. The report quoted Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, as saying that even the weakest among them would be a “historic nightmare” for the U.S. He declined to give any details,“If the U.S. troops do not leave our region voluntarily and upright, we will do something to carry their bodies horizontally out,” Shamkhani said.Iran’s parliament, meanwhile, passed an urgent bill declaring the U.S. military’s command at the Pentagon and those acting on its behalf in Soleimani’s killing as “terrorists,” subject to Iranian sanctions. The measure appears to be an attempt to mirror a decision by President Donald Trump in April to declare the Revolutionary Guard a “terrorist organization.”The U.S. Defense Department used the Guard’s designation as a terror organization in the U.S. to support the strike that killed Soleimani. The decision by Iran’s parliament, done by a special procedure to speed the bill to law, comes as officials across the country threaten to retaliate for Soleimani’s killing.The vote also saw lawmakers approve funding for the Quds Force with an additional 200 million euros, or about $224 million.Also Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the U.S. had declined to issue him a visa to travel to New York for upcoming meetings at the United Nations. The U.S. as the host of the U.N. headquarters is supposed to allow foreign officials to attend such meetings.“This is because they fear someone will go there and tell the truth to the American people,” Zarif said. “But they are mistaken. The world is not limited to New York. You can speak with American people from Tehran too and we will do that.”The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Solemani will be buried later Tuesday between the graves of Enayatollah Talebizadeh and Mohammad Hossein Yousef Elahi, two former Guard comrades. The two died in Operation Dawn 8 in Iran’s 1980s war with Iraq in which Soleimani also took part, a 1986 amphibious assault that cut Iraq off from the Persian Gulf and led to the end of the bloody war that killed 1 million people."

29ffaa49e71d33d5231558a35f2f2d1c,"Newly leaked documents show that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the Trump administration’s point man on trade and manufacturing policy, has a stake in a company that does business with a gas producer partly owned by the son-in-law of Russian President Vladimir Putin.According to records obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Ross is an investor in Navigator Holdings, a shipping giant that counts Russian gas and petrochemical producer Sibur among its major customers. Putin’s son-in-law Kirill Shamalov once owned more than 20 percent of the company, but now holds a much smaller stake.Commerce Department spokesman James Rockas said Ross “never met” Shamalov and has generally supported the Trump administration’s sanctions against Russia, according to the ICIJ report. Rockas added that Ross has withdrawn from matters related to transoceanic shipping vessels and has met the “highest ethical standards.”The details are likely to add to the questions about ties between Russia and the Trump administration, connections that for months have shadowed the White House and are a focus of an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller. Yet it wasn’t immediately clear how many partners Ross might have or what the profit-sharing agreement might be.ICIJ disclosed the Ross holding as part of reporting on 13.4 million records of offshore entities in tax havens leaked to German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. The newspaper then shared the records with ICIJ and a network of more than 380 journalists in 67 countries. The New York Times is its U.S. partner in this inquiry.The Times reported on the Ross holding on Sunday.It wasn’t immediately clear exactly how much of Navigator, which is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Ross personally owns. ICIJ reported that Ross and other investors own four Cayman Island entities that in turn own 31.5 percent of Navigator, a stake worth $176 million at Friday’s closing stock price.Ross’ stake in Navigator is likely a small fraction of that. In financial disclosure forms he filed with the government this year, Ross valued his holdings in the Cayman Island entities, which include other companies besides Navigator, at no more than $10.1 million.Sibur contributed 8 percent to Navigator’s revenue last year, according to reports filed with securities regulators. Russia’s energy sector is largely controlled by individuals with ties to state actors, including Putin.Much of the new trove of files includes bank statements, emails and loan agreements from Appleby, a law firm that helps set up offshore dummy companies and trusts. Appleby told the ICIJ that there is “no evidence” that it has done anything wrong.Other records came from Asiaciti Trust, a family-run offshore specialist based In Singapore, and from 19 corporate registries maintained by governments in jurisdictions that draw the wealthy seeking privacy.Big investments in two U.S. tech companies from a Russian government bank and Russian energy giant have also come to light.The ICIJ reported that Silicon Valley investor and Russian citizen Yuri Milner got $191 million from VTB Bank, and invested that money in Twitter. The leaked records also show that a financial subsidiary of Russian energy company Gazprom funded a shell company that invested in a Milner-affiliated company that held roughly $1 billion in Facebook shares shortly before its 2012 initial public offering.Milner told the ICIJ that he was unaware of any involvement by the Gazprom subsidiary in any of his deals and that none of his investments has been related to politics.Milner has also invested in a tech-savvy real estate fund that was co-founded by Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner called Cadre. Milner told the ICIJ that he used his own money for the investment.Sunday’s revelations follow last year’s release of records from a Panama-based firm involved in setting up offshore accounts. That disclosure triggered investigations in several countries, the resignation of the prime minister of Iceland and ouster of the leader of Pakistan. The Panama Papers also revealed that close associates of Russia’s leader Putin had been using the dummy accounts abroad to store their wealth, including a close Putin friend who had $2 billion of offshore assets.There are legitimate reasons for setting up offshore accounts, but lax regulation and anonymity in some jurisdictions make it easy to launder money, evade taxes and avoid regulatory scrutiny. Critics of the widening gap between the super-wealthy and the rest have seized upon the use of tax havens as revealed in the Panama Papers as evidence of a crisis, and governments have promised to crack down.In the case of Ross, the ICIJ reported Navigator’s Russian customer, Sibur, has ties to Putin in addition to his son-in-law.A big shareholder is Gennady Timchenko, who was targeted by the U.S. and other Western nations for sanctions after Russia’s invasion of the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014. A few months later, the U.S. barred banks from providing long-term financing to a gas company belonging to another large Sibur shareholder, Leonid Mikhelson. Mikhelson has also been sanctioned by the Treasury Department for propping up Putin’s rule.Sibur itself was not targeted by the U.S. sanctions, but the Bank of America and the Royal Bank of Scotland reportedly backed away from doing business with the company.The Russian gas producer last year contributed $23 million to Navigator’s revenue, an increase of more than 40 percent in two years"

93c5f4614e6664128fdc25966a1bd4cd,"Over 630,000 COVID-19 deaths predicted in US by June 1An influential coronavirus model has predicted there the US will register more than 631,000 deaths due to the novel coronavirus by June 1. Issued on Friday, the latest forecast from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington said that the result depends on the vaccine rollout and the spread of variants, reports Xinhua news agency. A worst-case scenario could see the death toll go as high as 703,000.Increasing the wearing of masks from the current level of 77 per cent to 95 per cent can save some 44,000 lives by June 1, according to the model.The IHME estimated that 17 per cent of people in the US have been infected as of February 1.The daily death rate is greater than 4 per million in 41 states.""Daily deaths have peaked and are declining. By June 1, 2021, we project that 123,600 lives will be saved by the projected vaccine rollout,"" the IHME said in the forecast.The best strategies to manage this period of the pandemic are rapid scale-up of vaccination, continued and expanded mask-wearing, and concerted efforts to avoid rebound mobility in the vaccinated, according to the institute.Some states are lifting mandates rapidly, which poses a real risk of increased transmission as new variants spread and vaccination rates remain comparatively low, the IHME warned.In its latest update on Saturday morning, the Johns Hopkins University revealed that the country's overall caseload and death toll stood at 26,804,927 and 459,278, respectively.January 2021 was by far the deadliest month of the pandemic in the country, with over 95,000 Covid-19 deaths, surpassing December 2020's total of over 77,000 deaths."
2b5e33fa3f3c1a51331d68243aeb0b96,"China is considering ending its limits on childbirth by 2025 after finding its population growth is slowing down, said a report.China is considering ending its limits on childbirth by 2025 after finding its population growth is slowing down, said a report. According to told The Wall Street Journal, the country could completely eliminate its childbirth restrictions at the end of the government's current five-year economic plan. China's National Bureau of Statistics found in May that the country's birth rate dropped for four consecutive years from 2016 to 2020.Xinjiang province has reportedly seen the sharpest birth rate drop globally since 1950. Citing sources TWJ stated that China would start easing restrictions in areas with the lowest birth rates before moving to other provinces.China has an ageing population due to its policies to sterilize women, force abortions on them, impose fine and give jail time to those who break rules surrounding giving birth.Last year, despite the changes, China produced fewer newborns than in any year since the depths of the Great Famine and the recent economic growth of the country, per capita income is still less than half that of neighbouring South Korea, reported Washington Post.Earlier, in a CNN article some experts questioned why Beijing did not scrap birth caps entirely? The reason might be Xinjiang. Ben Westcott, writing in CNN said that China kept a limit on parents because of Beijing's attitudes towards its ethnic minorities, particularly those in Xinjiang.The Chinese government has strictly enforced its family planning policies on minorities in the far-western province, where Beijing is accused of committing genocide against the Muslim-majority Uyghur people. The crackdown caused local birth rates to plunge by a third in 2018.Experts said Beijing is reluctant to remove all quotas on the number of children per family for several reasons. But one major factor is that ending the policy would make it much more difficult to justify Beijing's attempts to limit the population in Xinjiang and other regions with large minority groups, which tend to have more children, reported CNN.Moreover, retaining control over Xinjiang birth rates is not the only reason for the Chinese government's retention of three-child limits on families. Experts said Beijing would be reluctant to find new roles for the tens of thousands of people employed by the government to oversee the country's massive family planning policy.China's birth rate has been falling rapidly since the introduction of the one-child policy more than 40 years ago, which limited couples to one baby in order to alleviate poverty and stem a population boom.While the policy successfully reined in birth rates as China developed, in more recent years officials have become concerned the country won't have enough young workers to keep powering its economic growth.Faced with a demographic crisis, the Chinese government relaxed the policy in 2016 to allow for two children, but many couples in the Han middle class were reluctant to have more than one child, citing the high costs of raising families particularly in cities. In 2020, the birth rate fell by almost 15 per cent year on year. "

I applaud Prime Minister Modi and the Parliament for their leadership on ensuring the stability of Jammu and Kashmir,” Gosar said, welcoming the abrogation of provisions of Article 370 and bifurcation of the state into two union territories -- Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir -- on August 5.The two union territories came into existence on October 31 this year.“Just recently, the Indian Parliament passed legislation that changed the status of Jammu and Kashmir by modifying provisions that impeded economic development and affording the people of Jammu-Kashmir the same rights as the people of India,” he said, expressing his views on the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir within the greater context of the Indo-Pakistani conflict.“Article 370, an outdated provision of the law that governed Jammu-Kashmir, is no more. Article 370 and the polarised political environment that it created resulted in the loss of thousands of innocent lives within the region,” he said.“Pakistan-based terrorist organisations such as Lashkar-e-Taiba have conducted terrorist attacks that have disrupted the society and economy of Jammu-Kashmir.

f43838ff948c545eb4cb36bb07fcdb4e,"Authorities direct traffic on Hoffmeyer Road near the Vintage Place neighborhood where several law enforcement officers were shot, one fatally, on WednesdaySeven South Carolina law enforcement officers were shot, one fatally, in a confrontation with a suspect who held children hostage in a home and fired on deputies, officials said. The suspect was taken into custody after a two-hour standoff.Spokesman John Wukela in the city of Florence, where the deadly encounter occurred, gave an updated total Wednesday evening of officers felled by gunfire, speaking at an emotional news conference.Major Mike Nunn, with the Florence County Sheriff’s Department, said officers were serving a warrant when the suspect began shooting, wounding three deputies. The deputies had to be removed using a bulletproof vehicle.Then, four Florence police officers were shot while trying to respond to the initial gunfire, said Allen Heidler, the Florence police chief. It was one of Heidler’s officers who was killed during the confrontation.“I want you to pray for the family who lost the bravest police officer I have ever known,” Heidler said, visibly overcome by emotion at the news conference.Nunn said the suspect held off police for two hours — holding children hostage in his home — before eventually being taken into custody. He would not release the suspect’s name or condition and other details were not immediately disclosed.Condolences and outpourings of support rolled in at news of the shooting.“This is simply devastating news from Florence,” Gov. Henry McMaster tweeted. “The selfless acts of bravery from the men and women in law enforcement is real, just like the power of prayer is real.”Thom Berry, spokesman for the State Law Enforcement Division, said the agency had sent crime scene technicians to assist officials in Florence but at this time had not been requested to help with any investigation.Authorities said the shootings happened in Vintage Place, an upscale neighborhood in the western part of the city.Florence, a city in South Carolina’s northeastern corner home to roughly 37,000, sits at the convergence of Interstates 95 and 20. It’s the largest city in the region known as the Pee Dee, an area recently affected by heavy flooding in the wake of Hurricane Florence."

8345f0c05c0b4e34601000562a5beba6,"Russia Ukraine News: Joe Biden is ‘convinced’ Vladimir Putin has decided to invade UkraineU.S. President Joe Biden said Friday that he is “convinced” Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, including an assault on the capital, as tensions spiked along the militarized border with attacks that the West called “false-flag” operations meant to establish a pretext for invasion.A humanitarian convoy was hit by shelling, and pro-Russian rebels evacuated civilians from the conflict zone. A car bombing hit the eastern city of Donetsk, but no casualties were reported.After weeks of saying the U.S. wasn’t sure if Putin had made the final decision to invade, Biden said that assessment had changed, citing American intelligence. “As of this moment I’m convinced he’s made the decision,” Biden said. “We have reason to believe that.” He reiterated that the assault could occur in the “coming days.”Meanwhile, the Kremlin announced massive nuclear drills to flex its military muscle, and Putin pledged to protect Russia’s national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats.Biden reiterated his threat of massive economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia if it does invade, and pressed Putin to rethink his course of action. He said the U.S. and its Western allies were more united than ever to ensure Russia pays a price for the invasion.Also Read | Russia-Ukraine conflict: What Moscow wants, the West's interests | EXPLAINEDWith an estimated 150,000 Russian troops posted around Ukraine’s borders, U.S. and European officials warn that the long-simmering separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine could provide the spark for a broader attack.As further indication that the Russians are preparing for a potential invasion, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions nearer the border. That shift has been under way for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments.The official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups deployed in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each battalion tactical group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers.Lines of communication remain open: The U.S. and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday, and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called for de-escalation, the return of Russian forces surrounding Ukraine to their home bases and a diplomatic resolution, according to the Pentagon. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week.Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people.A bombing struck a car outside the main government building in the major eastern city of Donetsk, according to an Associated Press journalist there. The head of the separatist forces, Denis Sinenkov, said the car was his, the Interfax news agency reported.There were no reports of casualties and no independent confirmation of the circumstances of the blast. Uniformed men inspected the burned-out car.Shelling and shooting are common along the line that separates Ukrainian forces and the rebels, but targeted violence is unusual in rebel-held cities like Donetsk. However, the explosion and the announced evacuations were in line with U.S. warnings of so-called false-flag attacks that Russia would use to justify an invasion.Adding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early Saturday. The Luhansk Information Center said one of the blasts was in a natural gas main and cited witnesses as saying the other was at a vehicle service station. There was no immediate word on injuries or a cause. Luhansk officials blamed a gas main explosion earlier in the week on sabotage.Separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that form Ukraine’s industrial heartland known as the Donbas said they are evacuating civilians to Russia. The announcement appeared to be part of Moscow’s efforts to counter Western warnings of a Russian invasion and to paint Ukraine as the aggressor instead.Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk rebel government, said women, children and the elderly would go first, and that Russia has prepared facilities for them. Pushilin alleged in a video statement that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was going to order an imminent offensive in the area.Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago, The Associated Press confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin’s disinformation campaign could include prerecorded videos.Authorities began moving children from an orphanage in Donetsk, and other residents boarded buses for Russia. Long lines formed at gas stations as more people prepared to leave on their own.Putin ordered his emergencies minister to fly to the Rostov region bordering Ukraine to help organize the exodus and ordered the government to offer a payment of 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in the war-ravaged Donbas. Ukraine denied planning any offensive.“We are fully committed to diplomatic conflict resolution only,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.Around the volatile line of contact, a United Nations humanitarian convoy came under rebel shelling in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s military chief said. No casualties were reported. Rebels denied involvement and accused Ukraine of staging a provocation.Separatist authorities reported more shelling by Ukrainian forces along the line. A surge of shelling Thursday tore through the walls of a kindergarten, injuring two, and basic communications were disrupted. Both sides accused each other of opening fire.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the threat to global security is “more complex and probably higher” than during the Cold War. He told the Munich conference that a small mistake or miscommunication between major powers could have catastrophic consequences.Russia announced this week that it was pulling back forces from vast military exercises, but U.S. officials said they saw no sign of a pullback — and instead saw more troops moving toward the border with Ukraine.Meanwhile, the White House and the U.K. formally accused Russia of being responsible for recent cyberattacks targeting Ukraine’s defense ministry and major banks. The announcement was the most pointed attribution of responsibility for the cyber intrusions.Also Friday, the U.S. government released new estimates of how many military personnel Russia has in and around Ukraine. It said there are between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel, up from about about 100,000 on Jan. 30, according to Michael Carpenter, the permanent U.S. representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.The new estimate includes military troops along the border, in Belarus and in occupied Crimea, as well as Russian National Guard and other internal security units, and Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. The separatists inside Ukraine, the National Guard and troops in Crimea were not included in the previous U.S. estimate of 150,000.The Kremlin sent a reminder to the world of its nuclear might, announcing drills of its nuclear forces for the weekend. Putin will monitor the sweeping exercise Saturday that will involve multiple practice missile launches.Asked about Western warnings of a possible Russian invasion on Wednesday that didn’t materialize, Putin said: “There are so many false claims, and constantly reacting to them is more trouble than it’s worth.”“We are doing what we consider necessary and will keep doing so,” he said. “We have clear and precise goals conforming to national interests.”ALSO READ​ | Russia welcomes India's position for 'quiet and constructive diplomacy' on Ukraine situation "

}); }  Yameen on Monday declared a state of emergency. Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and another judge, Ali Hameed, were arrested hours after the government declared a state of emergency. No details were given about the investigation or any charges. Former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has allied himself with the Opposition, was detained at his home. Nasheed, whose Maldivian Democratic Party functions from Colombo, asked for India's help. He urged India to ""act swiftly"" to resolve the crisis. ""President Yameen's announcement which declares a state of emergency, the banning of fundamental freedoms, and the suspension of the Supreme Court is tantamount to a declaration of martial law in the Maldives. This declaration is unconstitutional and illegal.Nobody in the Maldives is required to, nor should, follow this unlawful order,"" Nasheed said.Nasheed also expressed concern over Yameen's deliberate delay in implementing the Supreme Court ruling to immediately release political prisoners.""This deliberate refusal by the government to uphold the Constitution further destabilises the Maldives and wider Indian Ocean security,"" Nasheed said.Nasheed, 50, the country's first democratically-elected leader -- was sentenced to 13 years in jail on terror charges in March 2015 over the arbitrary arrest of chief criminal judge Abdullah Muhammed during his presidency.He was granted asylum in the UK after he was authorised to seek medical treatment there amid mounting foreign pressure.Nasheed was narrowly defeated in 2013 by President Yameen. Nasheed says his conviction on terror charges was politically motivated The Maldivian government holds that Nasheed is convicted for a crime and is wanted in the Maldives to serve a jail sentence. Nasheed said he will seek UN support to ensure he is allowed to contest.What happened on Early Tuesday and MondayThe Maldives opposition leader and two Supreme Court judges were arrested early Tuesday hours after the government declared an emergency in the Indian Ocean nation that has been increasingly in turmoil in the days since the court ordered several jailed politicians to be freed.The charges against opposition leader Maumoon Abdul Gayoom include bribery and attempting to overthrow the government, his lawyer, Maumoon Hameed, said on Twitter. Gayoom was president from 1978 to 2008, when Maldives became a multiparty democracy, and is the half brother of the current president, under whose rule the archipelago has lost many of its democratic gains.The 15-day emergency decree issued late Monday gives the government sweeping powers to make arrests, search and seize property and restricts freedom of assembly, officials said.Soon after the declaration, security forces stormed into the Supreme Court building, where Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and judge Ali Hamid were arrested. The charges against them have not been specified. The whereabouts of the court's other two judges were not known Tuesday morning.Since the surprise, unanimous ruling last week ordering the release of imprisoned opposition leaders, President Yameen Abdul Gayoom has lashed out at the court, opposition protests have spilled into the streets of the capital, Male, and soldiers in riot gear have stopped lawmakers from meeting in the parliament building.In a statement issued after the state of emergency was announced on state television, Yameen said ""though certain rights will be restricted, general movements, services and businesses will not be affected.""In a letter to the court released by the president's office, Yameen said the court's order to release prisoners had encroached on the powers of the state and was an ""infringement of national security and public interest."" He urged the court to ""review the concerns"" of the government.The government has also said the court has not properly responded to letters citing problems with implementing its order, including that the cases against the political prisoners are at different legal stages. A Supreme Court statement on Sunday said ""there are no obstacles in implementing the ruling ... and that this has been informed to the Prosecutor General's office.""The government did not comment on soldiers entering the Supreme Court building or on Gayoom's arrest, but the president's main rival, who lives in exile, urged people not to obey what he called an ""unlawful order.""""This declaration is unconstitutional and illegal,"" former President Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected leader, said in a statement.Nasheed was one of the opposition leaders the Supreme Court had ordered freed, ruling that the guilty verdicts had been politically influenced.How UN, world powers reactedThe United Nations, United States and other foreign governments have urged the Maldives to respect the court order.The US also strongly criticized the emergency decree, which State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said also imposes travel restrictions.Yameen has ""systematically alienated his coalition, jailed or exiled every major opposition political figure"" since his election in 2013, Nauert said.She called on Yameen, the army, and police to comply with the rule of law, and for the constitutional rights of Maldivians to be restored.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was ""gravely concerned"" about the Maldives situation and asked ""Yameen and Maldives government to peacefully end the state of emergency, restore all articles of the constitution, take immediate steps to implement in full the order of the Supreme Court, and to permit and support the full, free and proper functioning of Parliament.""Australian ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Bryce Hutchesson said Australia ""calls on all parties to respect the rule of law, independence of the judiciary and the Supreme Court's decision.""In addition to ordering the release of the political prisoners, the court also reinstated 12 lawmakers who had been ousted for switching allegiance to the opposition. When those lawmakers return, Yameen's Progressive Party of the Maldives will lose its majority in the 85-member parliament, which could result in the legislative body functioning as a rival power to the president.The Maldives became a multiparty democracy 10 years ago after Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's rule, during which he was repeatedly the only candidate for the presidency.Nasheed won the nation's first democratic election in 2008 but resigned during his term following protests over the arrest of a judge. He lost the 2013 presidential election to Yameen, then was convicted under Maldives' anti-terrorism laws over ordering the judge arrested.

28dad001bd95e64ba23b4dd15f932dba,"China finally congratulates Joe Biden, Kamala Harris for their victory in US presidential electionChina on Friday shed its initial hesitation and congratulated US President-elect Joe Biden and his deputy Kamala Harris for their victory in the 2020 US presidential election, saying Beijing respects the choice of the American people.""We have been following reactions on the US elections from both within the US and the international community,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here when pointed out that more world leaders as well as United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres have congratulated 77-year-old Biden.""We respect the American people’s choice and we extend congratulations to Biden and Harris and we understand that the result of the US presidential elections will be determined following the US laws and procedures,"" Wang said.China initially hesitated to congratulate Biden, a Democrat, after Republican incumbent President Donald Trump refused to concede.On November 9, Wang had declined to congratulate Biden on his victory, saying the outcome of the American election should be determined by the country's laws and procedures.He, however, was more forthcoming on the victory of Harris as the first woman Vice President-elect.When reminded about Chinese President Xi Jinping’s statement calling for greater gender equality in a recent UN conference on women and doesChina have any comment on Harris, Wang quoted a Chinese saying which states women hold half of the sky.""In China, there is a saying that women hold half of the sky. China has been committed to realising gender equality and advancing women’s development around the world,"" he said.Trump’s four years in power were the worst phase in China-US relations as the ruling Communist Party of China headed by President Xi struggled to deal with what China’s officials say is the most elusive and unpredictable American leader ever since the former US president Richard Nixon in 1972 established ties with the Communist nation.During his tenure, Trump pushed aggressively on all aspects of US-China ties, including with his relentless trade war, challenging China’s military hold on the disputed South China Sea, its constant threats to Taiwan and branding coronavirus as ""China virus"" after it emerged from Wuhan in December last year.Chinese strategic experts said Biden entering the White House is expected to provide an opportunity for breakthroughs in resuming high-level communication and rebuilding mutual strategic trust between the two major countries.""The Biden tenure could usher in a buffering period for already-tense China-US relations and offer an opportunity for breakthroughs in resuming high-level communication and rebuilding mutual strategic trust between the two countries,” state-run Global Times quoted Chinese experts as saying on Monday.Jin Canrong, Associate Dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, said that Biden will usher in a ""buffer period"" for China-US relations - relations may still worsen, but not as quickly.""Biden will be more moderate and mature in handling foreign affairs,"" Jin said.Biden is expected to appoint more professional officials to his diplomatic team and so it will be possible for US-China tensions to take a brief timeout, he said.The vicious circle has led to damaged strategic mutual trust, a suspension of high-level communication and little concrete cooperation, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Centre for US Studies at Fudan University, told the daily.It might now be expected that some liaison mechanisms and stalled dialogues can be resumed, ""but it will take time to rebuild mutual strategic trust,"" he said.However, the pending change in US leadership will not change the overall direction of Washington's China policy, observers said.Regardless of who resides in the White House, the US will to some extent maintain its current approach toward China, the experts said."
20aad77a6ed14e840feb36a0bdaef5d2,"Refusing to take sides on the border standoff between India and China, the Pentagon has asked the two countries to engage in a direct dialogue to reduce the tension.“We encourage India and China to engage in direct dialogue aimed at reducing tensions and free of any coercive aspects,” Gary Ross, a Defence Department spokesman said.  Interestingly, the Pentagon spokesman added that the dialogue should be free of any “coercive asopects”.The statement assumes significance as almost all the  neighbours of China have accused it of applying coercive tactics to settle border disputes.The month-long India-China border standoff in the Sikkim sector is seen as part of same Chinese coercive tactics to change the status quo. India has taken a strong stand against such a Chinese move. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval heads to Beijing to attend a meeting of BRICS later this month. During his visit, Doval is expected to talk with his Chinese counterpart on this issue. Responding to questions, the Pentagon refused to take sides on the issue. “We refer you to the Governments of India and China for further information. We encourage India and China to engage in direct dialogue aimed at reducing tensions. We are not going to speculate on such matters,” Ross said when asked if the Pentagon fears escalation of tension between India and China.  Early this week, a top Pentagon Commander told lawmakers that China is exploiting its economic leverage as a way to its regional political objectives. “The Chinese have shown their willingness to exploit their economic leverage as a way to advance their regional political objectives. As China’s military modernisation continues, the United States and its allies and partners will continue to be challenged to balance China’s influence,” General Paul Selva, USAF, said in written response to questions to the Senate Armed Services Committee for his nominee for reconfirmation as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Selva said deterring war is an exercise in influencing China’s decision calculus, making diplomacy preferable to conflict and managing crises in such a manner that they do not unintentionally escalate. “To do this, the Joint Force will engage with the Chinese military within Congressionally mandated limits, build alliance capacity through close cooperation, and uphold international law through appropriate operations,” he said in written response to the questions.(With PTI inputs)"

5316ca489b162c20578cb65747754b5d,"Even as his administration fights for its travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries, President Donald Trump is using the nation that is home to Islam’s holiest site as a backdrop to call for Muslim unity in the fight against terrorism.Trump’s Sunday speech, the centerpiece of his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, will address the leaders of 50 Muslim-majority countries to cast the challenge of extremism as a “battle between good and evil” and urge Arab leaders to “drive out the terrorists from your places of worship,” according to a draft of the speech obtained by The Associated Press.Trump, whose campaign was frequently punctuated by bouts of anti-Islamic rhetoric, is poised to soften some of his language about Islam. Though during the campaign he repeatedly stressed the need to say the words “radical Islamic terrorism” — and criticized his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for not doing so — that phrase is not included in the draft.The speech comes amid a renewed courtship of the United States’ Arab allies as Trump is set to have individual meetings with leaders of several nations, including Egypt and Qatar, before then participating in a roundtable with the Gulf Cooperation Council and joining Saudi King Salman in opening Riyadh’s new anti-terrorism center.The address also notably refrains from mentioning democracy and human rights — topics Arab leaders often view as U.S. moralizing — in favor of the more limited goals of peace and stability.“We are not here to lecture — to tell other peoples how to live, what to do or who to be. We are here instead to offer partnership in building a better future for us all,” according to the copy of his speech.Two different sources provided the AP with copies of the draft of his remarks, billed as a marquee speech of the trip. The White House confirmed the draft was authentic, but cautioned the president had not yet signed off on the final product and that changes could be made.Trump may seem an unlikely messenger to deliver an olive branch to the Muslim world.During his campaign, he mused, “I think Islam hates us.” And only a week after taking office, he signed an executive order to ban immigrants from seven countries — Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen — from entering the United States, a decision that sparked widespread protests at the nation’s airports and demonstrations outside the White House.That ban was blocked by the courts. A second order, which dropped Iraq from the list, is tied up in federal court and the federal government is appealing.White House officials have said they consider Trump’s visit, and his keynote address, a counterweight to President Barack Obama’s debut speech to the Muslim world in 2009 in Cairo.Obama called for understanding and acknowledged some of America’s missteps in the region. That speech was denounced by many Republicans and criticized by a number of the United States’ Middle East allies as being a sort of apology.Saudi Arabia’s leaders soured on Obama, and King Salman did not greet him at the airport during his final visit to the kingdom. But on Saturday, the 81-year-old king, aided by a cane, walked along the red carpet to meet Trump as a fleet of military jets swept through the sky, leaving a red, white and blue trail in their wake. During a ceremony at the grand Saudi Royal Court, the king awarded Trump the Collar of Abdulaziz al Saud, the theocracy’s highest civilian honor.Trump bent down so the king could place the gold medal around his neck. Saudi Arabia has previously bestowed the honor on Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and Obama.The president’s stop in Saudi Arabia’s dusty desert capital kicked off his first foreign trip as president, an ambitious, five-stop swing that will take him through the Middle East and into Europe. He’s the only American president to make Saudi Arabia — or any Muslim-majority nation — his first overseas visit.Trump arrived in Riyadh besieged by the fallout from his controversial decision to fire FBI Director James Comey and more revelations about the federal investigations into his campaign’s possible ties to Russia. But escaping Washington for the gold-plated embrace of the Saudi royal family — a decor not so unlike Trump’s own Manhattan home — appeared to give the president a boost.The president was largely kept out of earshot from reporters, rendering them unable to ask about the tumult back home. But he did make a brief utterance to the press pool, deeming the proceedings “a tremendous day.”Trump is scheduled to leave Saudi Arabia, home to Mecca, the holiest site in Islam, early Monday to head to Israel."
da22ec492cda3ffd8e8e08a0b57ab921,"Companies test antibody drugs to treat, prevent COVID-19With a coronavirus vaccine still months off, companies are rushing to test what may be the next best thing: drugs that deliver antibodies to fight the virus right away, without having to train the immune system to make them.Antibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. Vaccines work by tricking the body into thinking there’s an infection so it makes antibodies and remembers how to do that if the real bug turns up.But it can take a month or two after vaccination or infection for the most effective antibodies to form. The experimental drugs shortcut that process by giving concentrated versions of specific ones that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests.“A vaccine takes time to work, to force the development of antibodies. But when you give an antibody, you get immediate protection,” said University of North Carolina virologist Dr. Myron Cohen. “If we can generate them in large concentrations, in big vats in an antibody factory ... we can kind of bypass the immune system.”These drugs are believed to last for a month or more and could give quick, temporary immunity to people at high risk of infection, such as health workers and housemates of someone with COVID-19. If they proved effective and if a vaccine doesn’t materialize or protect as hoped, the drugs might eventually be considered for wider use, perhaps for teachers or other groups.They’re also being tested as treatments, to help the immune system and prevent severe symptoms or death.“The hope there is to target people who are in the first week of their illness and that we can treat them with the antibody and prevent them from getting sick,” said Dr. Marshall Lyon, an infectious disease specialist helping to test one such drug at Emory University in Atlanta.Having such a tool “would be a really momentous thing in our fight against COVID,” Cohen said.Vaccines are seen as a key to controlling the virus, which has been confirmed to have infected more than 20 million people worldwide and killed more than 738,000. Several companies are racing to develop vaccines, but the results of the large final tests needed to evaluate them are months away.The antibody drugs are “very promising” and, in contrast, could be available “fairly soon,” said Dr. Janet Woodcock, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration official who is leading government efforts to speed COVID-19 therapies. Key studies are underway and some answers should come by early fall.One company, Eli Lilly, has already started manufacturing its antibody drug, betting that studies now underway will give positive results.“Our goal is to get something out as soon as possible” and to have hundreds of thousands of doses ready by fall, said Lilly’s chief scientific officer, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky.Another company that developed an antibody drug cocktail against Ebola — Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. — now is testing one for coronavirus.“The success with our Ebola program gives us some confidence that we can potentially do this again,” said Christos Kyratsous, a Regeneron microbiologist who helped lead that work.Regeneron’s drug uses two antibodies to enhance chances the drug will work even if the virus evolves to evade action by one.Lilly is testing two different, single-antibody drugs — one with the Canadian company AbCellera and another with a Chinese company, Junshi Biosciences. In July, Junshi said no safety concerns emerged in 40 healthy people who tried it and that larger studies were getting underway.Others working on antibody drugs include Amgen and Adaptive Biotechnologies. The Singapore biotech company Tychan Pte Ltd. also is testing an antibody drug and has similar products in development for Zika virus and yellow fever.“I’m cautiously optimistic” about the drugs, said the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. “I’m heartened by the experience that we had with Ebola,” where the drugs proved effective.What could go wrong?— The antibodies may not reach all of the places in the body where they need to act, such as deep in the lungs. All the antibody drugs are given through an IV and must make their way through the bloodstream to wherever they’re needed.— The virus might mutate to avoid the antibody — the reason Regeneron is testing a two-antibody combo that binds to the virus in different places to help prevent its escape.Skovronsky said Lilly stuck with one antibody because manufacturing capacity would essentially be cut in half to make two, and “you will have less doses available.” If a single antibody works, “we can treat twice as many people,” he said.— The antibodies might not last long enough. If they fade within a month, it’s still OK for treatment since COVID-19 illness usually resolves in that time. But for prevention, it may not be practical to give infusions more often than every month or two.A San Francisco company, Vir Biotechnology Inc., says it has engineered antibodies to last longer than they usually do to avoid this problem. GlaxoSmithKline has invested $250 million in Vir to test them.Giving a higher dose also may help. If half of antibodies disappear after a month, “if you give twice as much, you will have two months’ protection,” Lilly’s Skovronsky said.— The big fear: Antibodies may do the opposite of what’s hoped and actually enhance the virus’s ability to get into cells or stimulate the immune system in a way that makes people sicker. It’s a theoretical concern that hasn’t been seen in testing so far, but large, definitive experiments are needed to prove safety.“As best as we can tell, the antibodies are helpful,” Lyon said."

94f12ce31f6e5f484e34b7e02024997f,"Extra COVID vaccine OK’d for those with weak immune systems: FDA.  US regulators say transplant recipients and others with severely weakened immune systems can get an extra dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to better protect them as the delta variant continues to surge.The late-night announcement on Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration applies to several million Americans who are especially vulnerable because of organ transplants, certain cancers or other disorders. Several other countries, including France and Israel, have similar recommendations.It’s harder for vaccines to rev up an immune system suppressed by certain medications and diseases, so those patients don’t always get the same protection as otherwise healthy people- and small studies suggest for at least some, an extra dose may be the solution.“Today’s action allows doctors to boost immunity in certain immunocompromised individuals who need extra protection from COVID-19,” Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA’s acting commissioner, said in a statement.The FDA determined that transplant recipients and others with a similar level of compromised immunity can receive a third dose of the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at least 28 days after getting their second shot. The FDA made no mention of immune-compromised patients who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.The announcement comes as the extra-contagious delta version of the coronavirus surges through much of the country, pushing new cases, hospitalizations and deaths to heights not seen since last winter.Importantly, the FDA’s decision only applies to this high-risk group, estimated to be no more than 3% of US adults. It’s not an opening for booster doses for the general population.Instead, health authorities consider the extra dose part of the initial prescription for the immune-compromised. For example, France since April has encouraged that such patients get a third dose four weeks after their regular second shot. Israel and Germany also recently began recommending a third dose of two-dose vaccines.Separately, US health officials are continuing to closely monitor if and when average people’s immunity wanes enough to require boosters for everyone- but for now, the vaccines continue to offer robust protection for the general population.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to formally recommend the extra shots for certain immune-compromised groups after a meeting Friday of its outside advisers.Transplant recipients and others with suppressed immune systems know they’re at more risk than the average American and some have been seeking out extra doses on their own, even if it means lying about their vaccination status. The change means now the high-risk groups can more easily get another shot- but experts caution it’s not yet clear exactly who should.“This is all going to be very personalized,” cautioned Dr Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon at Johns Hopkins University who is running a major National Institutes of Health study of extra shots for organ recipients. For some people, a third dose “increases their immune response. Yet for some people it does not seem to. We don’t quite know who’s who yet.”One recent study of more than 650 transplant recipients found just over half harbored virus-fighting antibodies after two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines- although generally less than in otherwise healthy vaccinated people. Another study of people with rheumatoid arthritis and similar autoimmune diseases found only those who use particular medications have very poor vaccine responses.There’s little data on how well a third dose works, and if it causes any safety problems such as an increased risk of organ rejection. Wednesday, Canadian researchers reported that transplant recipients were more likely to have high levels of antibodies if they got a third dose than those given a dummy shot for comparison. Other small studies have similarly found that some transplant recipients respond to a third dose while others still lack enough protection.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_7559922646 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_kgzqk08p/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_kgzqk08p_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Johnson & Johnson's single-dose Covid vaccine approved in India"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""47"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_7559922646 = ''; jwsetup_7559922646(); function jwsetup_7559922646() { jwvidplayer_7559922646 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_7559922646"").setup(jwconfig_7559922646); jwvidplayer_7559922646.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_7559922646, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_kgzqk08p\"", ns_st_pr=\""Johnson & Johnson's single-dose Covid vaccine approved in India\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Johnson & Johnson's single-dose Covid vaccine approved in India\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Johnson & Johnson's single-dose Covid vaccine approved in India\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-08-07\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-08-07\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_kgzqk08p/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_7559922646.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_7559922646.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_7559922646.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_7559922646.stop(); jwvidplayer_7559922646.remove(); jwvidplayer_7559922646 = ''; jwsetup_7559922646(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_7559922646.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_7559922646.stop(); jwvidplayer_7559922646.remove(); jwvidplayer_7559922646 = ''; jwsetup_7559922646(); return; }); jwvidplayer_7559922646.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_7559922646.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_7559922646.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_7559922646.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_7559922646.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_7559922646.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

Ameer is also said to be among the frontline leaders of the Khalistani movement in Pakistan, according to the Political Edge.India had voiced objections to the presence of pro-Khalistani elements in the PSGPC panel which would coordinate the activities of the Kartarpur corridor, including the movement of Sikh pilgrims from India to Narowal in Pakistan where the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan, is located. The project will allow easy access to Sikh pilgrims from India to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur in Pakistan, the final resting place of Guru Nanak.""Issues pertaining to the modalities of the corridor, who can use the corridor and its facilities, how can the pilgrims move across with regards to documents required for the travel, how many pilgrims can travel will be on the agenda during the meeting,"" sources said.They also added that a ""hi-tech and robust security system"" will be in place when the corridor becomes operational.""Security is paramount and non-negotiable,"" they said.The sources said the work on a four-lane highway on the Indian side is in full swing.The four-lane highway connecting the Zero Point of the Kartarpur Corridor up to National Highway-354 is being constructed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Pakistan is constructing a two-lane highway.Officials said the work on the four-lane highway should be completed by September.The sources said India is constructing a bridge at the Zero Point and has urged Pakistan to build a similar bridge on its side that will provide safe and secure movement of the pilgrims and address concerns regarding flooding.The bridge is over a creek, of which the majority part falls in Pakistan.Pakistan said it would build a mud-filled embankment, a move which would not only lead to flooding in areas on the Indian side but also pose a threat to the structure of the bridge, the sources added.The creek floods during the monsoon when the Ravi river swells.Another proposal put forth by Pakistan was to build a causeway, the sources said, adding that it was unacceptable to India as it would not provide an all-weather road.They said the construction work at the site of passenger terminal complex at Dera Baba Nanak in India is on full swing.The work has been planned to be completed by October 31 before the commemoration of 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak in November.More than 250 labourers and 30 engineers are working at the site in three shifts, they said.The terminal is being built on around 15 acres of land with comprehensive facilities to cater to approximately 5,000 pilgrims daily, the sources said.The complex will have the robust security systems with CCTV surveillance and other advance security systems and adequate parking space for 10 buses, 250 cars, and 250 two- wheelers.The area will be developed with amalgamation of rich Indian culture and state-of-the-art infrastructure with eye- soothing landscaping. More than Rs 500 crore will been spent for the development of this complex.""On special days, we are expecting 10,000 pilgrims a day,"" one of the sources said.The passenger terminal building is being constructed by the Land Ports Authority of India. The work for it was awarded to the Shapoorji Pallonji Group on May 29.The land acquisition process has been completed with the support of the Punjab government and the project is scheduled to be completed by October 31.The total cost of the project is Rs 177.5 crore.In November 2018, Pakistan agreed to set up the border-crossing linking Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak, to Dera Baba Nanak in Punjab's Gurdaspur district.Kartarpur is located in Pakistan's Narowal district, about four km from Dera Baba Nanak.Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had on November 26 last year laid the foundation stone of the Kartarpur corridor in Gurdaspur district.Two days later, the Pakistani prime minister laid the foundation stone of the corridor in Narowal, around 125 km from Lahore.Also Read | Pakistani mafia using bribe, blackmailing to put pressure on Judiciary: Imran KhanAlso Read | Pakistan removes pro-Khalistani leader from Kartarpur panel, but includes anotherWatch TV Coverage   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

We may be doing some other things, we have a couple of options… But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok."" Trump's latest comments have come after reports surfaced that Microsoft is planning to buy ByteDance 's TikTok.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said, early July, that the US was planning action against TikTok because of the threat it poses to user privacy.Several US politicians have constantly criticised TikTok which is owned by Beijing based ByteDance. It has long been tipped as a ‘threat to national security’.This is also partly due to the deteriorating ties between the United States and China.India has already banned TikTok, among over 100 Chinese Apps that violated user privacy and data security norms.In a major development, tech giants Microsoft is in talks to buy the video-sharing app TikTok’s operations in the United States. US media has reported that a deal would give the software company a popular social media service and relieve US government pressure on the Chinese owner ByteDance. "

Covid-19 Vaccine, the US Food and Drug Administration has informed the sponsor that it will rapidly work toward finalisation and issuance of an emergency use authorisation, FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement late on Friday. The agency has already notified federal partners involved in vaccine allocation and distribution to get ready for the rollout.Once FDA clears the J&J shot for US use, only a few million doses are expected to be ready for shipping in the first week. J&J told US Congress that it expects to deliver 20 million doses by the end of March and 100 million by June. The company aims to produce around a billion doses by the end of the year.America, which began its historic vaccination drive on December 14 last year, has delivered a total of more than 70 million jabs in arms across first and second doses combined. More than 47 million people in the US have received at least one shot. The two vaccines currently in use - Pfizer and Moderna - are both two shot vaccines spaced about 3-4 weeks apart.US FDA scientists have already confirmed that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is safe and is about 66 per cent effective at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19, and about 85 per cent effective against serious illness. Similar to the other Covid-19 vaccines in the US, the main side effects of the J&J shot are pain at the injection site and flu-like fever, fatigue and headache.J&J tested its single-dose option in about 44,000 adults in the US, Latin America and South Africa with a 2-month median follow-up. ""The analysis supported a favourable safety profile with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude the issuance of a EUA,"" the US FDA said of the J&J vaccine.The FDA noted that there were no Covid-19-related deaths and no Covid-19 cases requiring medical intervention 28 days or more post-vaccination among participants age 60 years or older with medical comorbidities in the vaccine group."

Murthy, 43, said that there was no reason to believe that the coronavirus vaccines that have already been developed would not be effective against the new strain as well.""This news from the UK appears to be about a new strain of the virus that’s more transmissible, more contagious than the virus we’ve seen prior to this,"" he said.""While it seems to be more transmissible, we do not have evidence yet that this is a more deadly virus to an individual who acquires it,"" Murthy told NBC News on Sunday.Several countries have announced restrictions on UK travel and suspended flights amid growing concerns of an ""out of control"" new variant of coronavirus spreading at a much faster pace in parts of England.ALSO READ | New coronavirus variant identified in UK; London to be put under highest level of restrictionsIt is thought the variant either emerged in a patient in the UK or has been imported from a country with a lower ability to monitor coronavirus mutations.""The bottom line is if you're at home and you're hearing this news, it does not change what we do in terms of precautions as individuals that can reduce the spread of this virus.

b754b36de7ffa5086741ba061174eb88,"Japanese weather satellite, and released by the agency, shows an undersea volcano eruption at the Pacific nation of Tonga Saturday, Jan. 15, 2022.An undersea volcano erupted in spectacular fashion Saturday near the Pacific nation of Tonga, sending large tsunami waves crashing across the shore and people rushing to higher ground. A tsunami advisory was in effect for Hawaii, Alaska and the U.S. Pacific coast. There were no immediate reports of injuries or on the extent of the damage because all internet connectivity with Tonga was lost at about 6:40 p.m. local time, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis for the network intelligence firm Kentik.Tonga gets its internet via an undersea cable from Suva, Fiji, which presumably was damaged. The company that manages that connection, Southern Cross Cable Network, could not immediately be reached for comment.Tonga’s Islands Business news site reported that a convoy of police and military troops evacuated King Tupou VI from his palace near the shore. He was among the many residents who headed for higher ground.In Hawaii, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported waves that measured half a meter (1.6 feet) in Nawiliwili, Kauai and 80 centimeters (2.7 feet) in Hanalei. The National Weather Service said there were reports of boats getting pushed up in docks, but the hazard was diminishing.“We are relieved that there is no reported damage and only minor flooding throughout the islands,” the tsunami center said, describing the situation in Hawaii.On Tonga, home to about 105,000 people, video posted to social media showed large waves washing ashore in coastal areas, swirling around homes, a church and other buildings. Satellite images showed a huge eruption, with a plume of ash, steam and gas rising like a mushroom above the blue Pacific waters.New Zealand’s military said it was monitoring the situation and remained on standby, ready to assist if asked.The Tonga Meteorological Services said a tsunami warning was declared for all of the archipelago, and data from the Pacific tsunami center said waves of 80 centimeters (2.7 feet) were detected.A Twitter user identified as Dr. Faka’iloatonga Taumoefolau posted video showing waves crashing ashore. “Can literally hear the volcano eruption, sounds pretty violent,” he wrote, adding in a later post: “Raining ash and tiny pebbles, darkness blanketing the sky.”The explosion of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano was the latest in a series of dramatic eruptions. Earth imaging company Planet Labs PBC had been watching the island in recent days after a new volcanic vent there began erupting in late December.Satellite images captured by Planet Labs show how drastically the volcano had shaped the area, creating a growing island off Tonga. “The surface area of the island appears to have expanded by nearly 45% due to ashfall,” Planet said days before the latest activity.Following Saturday’s eruption, residents in Hawaii, Alaska and along the U.S. Pacific coast were advised to move away from the coastline to higher ground and to pay attention to specific instructions from their local emergency management officials, said Dave Snider, tsunami warning coordinator for the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska.“We don’t issue an advisory for this length of coastline as we’ve done - I’m not sure when the last time was - but it really isn’t an everyday experience,” Snider said.He said the waves slamming ashore in Hawaii were just under the criteria for a more serious tsunami warning.“The important thing here is the first wave may not be the largest. We could see this play out for several hours,” he added. “It looks like everything will stay below the warning level, but it’s difficult to predict because this is a volcanic eruption, and we’re set up to measure earthquake or seismic-driven sea waves.”The first waves to hit the continental United States measured about 30 centimeters (1 foot) in Nikolski and Adak, Alaska. A wave of about 20 centimeters (.7 feet) was observed in Monterey, California, the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said in a tweet.Beaches and piers were closed across Southern California as a precaution. The National Weather Service tweeted there were “no significant concerns about inundation.” Strong rip currents were possible, however, and officials warned people to stay out of the water.On California’s central coast, the National Weather Service reported tsunami waves up to 2.5 feet (.76 meters) and flooding in beach parking lots at Port San Luis. About 200 miles (320 km) down the coast, the waves were much smaller at Southern California’s Seal Beach, according to Michael Pless, the owner of M&M Surf School.“The waves are looking pretty flat,” Pless said. “We’re hoping they reopen the beach in a couple hours.”Crowds gathered at the Santa Cruz harbor in California early Saturday to watch water slowly rise and fall, straining boat ties on docks. In 2011, after the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, a series of surges cost $20 million of damage in the harbor.Residents of American Samoa were alerted of the tsunami warning by local broadcasters as well as church bells that rang territory-wide. An outdoor siren warning system was out of service. Those living along the shoreline quickly moved to higher ground.As night fell, there were no reports of any damage and the Hawaii-based tsunami center canceled the alert.Authorities in the nearby island nations of Fiji and Samoa also issued warnings, telling people to avoid the shoreline due to strong currents and dangerous waves. The Japan Meteorological Agency said there may be slight swelling of the water along the coast, but it was not expected to cause any damage.More than 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles) away from Tonga in New Zealand, officials warned of possible storm surges from the eruption.New Zealand’s private forecaster, Weather, Watch tweeted that people as far away as Southland, the country’s southernmost region, reported hearing sonic booms from the eruption. Others reported that many boats were damaged by a tsunami that hit a marina in Whangarei, in the Northland region.Earlier, the Matangi Tonga news site reported that scientists observed massive explosions, thunder and lightning near the volcano after it started erupting early Friday. Satellite images showed a 5-kilometer (3- mile) -wide plume rising into the air to about 20 kilometers (12 miles).The Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano is located about 64 kilometers (40 miles) north of the capital, Nuku’alofa. In late 2014 and early 2015, a series of eruptions in the area created a small new island and disrupted international air travel to the Pacific archipelago for several days.There is not a significant difference between volcanoes underwater and on land, and underwater volcanoes become bigger as they erupt, at some point usually breaching the surface, said Hans Schwaiger, a research geophysicist with the Alaska Volcano Observatory. With underwater volcanoes, however, the water can add to the explosivity of the eruption as it hits the lava, Schwaiger added.Before an explosion, there is generally an increase in small local earthquakes at the volcano, but depending on how far it is from land, that may not be felt by residents along the shoreline, Schwaiger said.In 2019, Tonga lost internet access for nearly two weeks when the same fiber-optic cable was severed. The director of the local cable company said at the time that a large ship may have cut the cable by dragging an anchor.

69f9fdcc8c12ab6c21eb064190852abc,"Japan’s leader may have made the right call after all, if not for his country then for himself. Media polls indicate Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling coalition will handily win a general election Sunday, possibly even retaining its two-thirds majority in the more powerful lower house of parliament.Japanese voters may not love Abe, but they appear to want to stick with what they know, rather than hand the reins to an opposition with little or no track record. Uncertainly over North Korea and its growing missile and nuclear arsenal may be heightening that underlying conservatism.“I buy into Prime Minister Abe’s ability to handle diplomacy,” said Naomi Mochida, a 51-year-old woman listening to Abe campaign earlier this week in Saitama prefecture, outside of Tokyo. “I think the most serious threat we face now is the North Korea situation. I feel Prime Minister Abe has been showing the best tactics to handle the situation, compared to other politicians including past prime ministers.”Abe dissolved the lower house a little more than three weeks ago on the day it convened for a special session, forcing the snap election. The timing seemed ripe for his ruling Liberal-Democratic Party, or at least better than waiting.Support for Abe’s Cabinet, the standard measure of a government’s popularity in Japan, had bounced back from summertime lows. The main opposition force, the Democratic Party, was in more disarray than usual after its leader had resigned. Holding off would only give a potential rival, Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, more time to organize a challenge.The election is “mainly about the Abe administration trying to lock in its position ... and with success, get Prime Minister Abe re-elected as president of the LDP in September and rule until after the Tokyo Olympics, until 2021,” Michael Green, a Japan expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said on a call with journalists.Koike, her hand forced by Abe’s decision, hastily launched a new party to contest the election. Her Party of Hope briefly stole the limelight from Abe, attracting a slew of defectors from the Democrats. Its populist platform includes phasing out nuclear power by 2030, and putting on hold an increase in the consumption tax due in 2019.But Abe’s gambit appears to be paying off. The initial excitement for the Party of Hope has waned. Koike, the party leader, decided not to run for the 465-seat lower house and won’t even be in Japan on election day. She is heading to Paris for a global conference of mayors that will discuss issues such as climate change.The Democratic Party has imploded. Its more liberal members have launched yet another grouping, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, which is now outpolling the Party of Hope.“To be honest, I wish we had strong opposition,” said Ko Horiguchi, a 71-year-old retiree listening to Abe’s campaign speech. “But look at their sorry situation right now.”For the rest of the world, an Abe victory would likely mean a continuation of the policies he has pursued in the nearly five years since he took office in December 2012.That includes a hard line on North Korea. Abe says it’s not the time for dialogue and has pushed for tougher sanctions to try to pressure leader Kim Jong Un to abandon the country’s weapons development.He has backed a loose monetary policy that has boosted the stock market and breathed temporary life into a long-stagnant Japanese economy, though many of the gains haven’t filtered down to working people, raising doubts about the sustainability of the recovery.A strong election showing would boost Abe’s chances of being reappointed to another three-year term as leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party next September, extending his premiership. That could make Abe the longest-serving prime minister in the post-World War II era.It would also give him more time to try to win over a reluctant public to his longtime goal of revising the postwar Japanese Constitution. He may get the two-thirds majority he needs in parliament for a constitutional amendment, but any change also needs approval in a public referendum."
5a2388238c591c6a791616b2660a3e5f,"In this satellite photo released by Planet Labs Inc., Kabul's international airport is seen amid evacuations on Monday.A Taliban spokesman on Tuesday said the U.S. must complete its evacuation of people from Afghanistan by the August 31 date the President Joe Biden-administration set for the withdrawal of all American troops.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that his group will accept ""no extensions"" to the deadline. He says life is returning to normal in the country but chaos at the airport remains a problem. Many Afghans are desperate to flee the Taliban takeover of the country.Earlier in the day, the director of the CIA met with the Taliban’s top political leader in Kabul, an official said, as more reports emerged of abuses in areas held by the fighters, fueling concerns about Afghanistan's future and the fate of those racing to leave the country before the looming U.S. withdrawal.A Taliban spokesman dashed hopes that an American-led evacuation could continue beyond an Aug. 31 deadline to allow more time for Western powers to get their citizens and vulnerable Afghans out of the country.Recent days have seen a flurry of efforts to speed the chaotic operation at Kabul's airport, where scenes of desperation have highlighted both the disarray of the American pullout and fears that the Taliban will again impose a brutal rule.While details of William Burns’ discussion with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar on Monday were not released, the meeting represents an extraordinary moment for a CIA that for two decades targeted the Taliban in paramilitary operations. And it gives a sense of the extent of the wrangling happening ahead of the end of America's two-decade war in the country.ALSO READ | Taliban tell women Afghan govt workers to stay home until security allowsALSO READ | Taliban claim no 'house-to-house' searches taking place in Kabul   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_7524458562 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_fb9vcrro/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_fb9vcrro_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Taliban warns of 'consequences' if August 31 deadline for US-led troop withdrawal is extended"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""1778"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_7524458562 = ''; jwsetup_7524458562(); function jwsetup_7524458562() { jwvidplayer_7524458562 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_7524458562"").setup(jwconfig_7524458562); jwvidplayer_7524458562.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_7524458562, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_fb9vcrro\"", ns_st_pr=\""Taliban warns of 'consequences' if August 31 deadline for US-led troop withdrawal is extended\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Taliban warns of 'consequences' if August 31 deadline for US-led troop withdrawal is extended\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Taliban warns of 'consequences' if August 31 deadline for US-led troop withdrawal is extended\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-08-23\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-08-23\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_fb9vcrro/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_7524458562.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_7524458562.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_7524458562.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_7524458562.stop(); jwvidplayer_7524458562.remove(); jwvidplayer_7524458562 = ''; jwsetup_7524458562(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_7524458562.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_7524458562.stop(); jwvidplayer_7524458562.remove(); jwvidplayer_7524458562 = ''; jwsetup_7524458562(); return; }); jwvidplayer_7524458562.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_7524458562.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_7524458562.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_7524458562.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_7524458562.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_7524458562.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, COVID-19 Technical Lead at the WHO, said Monday that the B.1.617 virus variant that was first identified in India had been classified as a “variant of interest” by the WHO.She said the Epi team and WHO lab team has been discussing with the WHO virus evolution working group this variant and everything that “we know about it in terms of transmissibility and any studies that are being done in India as well as in other countries where this virus is circulating.“In consultation with our virus evolution working group, and our Epi teams and our lab teams internally, there is some available information to suggest increased transmissibility of B-1617… as such we are classifying this as a variant of concern at the global level,” she said.She added that even though there is increased transmissibility demonstrated by some preliminary studies, “we need much more information about this virus variant in this lineage…so we need more targeted sequencing to be done, and to be shared in India and elsewhere so that we know how much of this virus is circulating.”She added that there is need for more information on the epidemiologic studies that are underway, the studies that are evaluating neutralization severity.“So far from the information that we have (is) the public health and social measures work, but we need to work that much harder to control any virus variants that have demonstrated increased transmissibility,” she said, adding that WHO does not have anything to suggest that “our diagnostics or therapeutics and our vaccines don't work.“This is important. We will continue to see variants emerge. We will continue to see variants of concern around the world and we must do everything that we can to really limit the spread, limit infections, prevent the spread and reduce severe disease and death with the tools that we have at hand,” she said.She emphasised that no matter where one lives and no matter what viruses are circulating, “we need to make sure that we take all of the measures at hand to prevent ourselves from getting sick. It's the individual level measures, physical distancing, hand hygiene, wearing of a mask, avoiding crowded spaces, improving ventilation…if you can work from home, all of the measures that are at hand and ensuring that governments provide a supportive and an enabling environment so that we can carry out measure that can keep us safe,” she added.ALSO READ: India's double mutant Covid variant found in 17 countries: WHOALSO READ: WHO to restart Covid drug trial with focus on immune responses"

All are believed to be “associates” of the dead passenger, police said.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was due to chair a meeting of the government’s COBRA crisis committee on Monday in response to the blast.Suspicions about a motive for the explosion have been aroused by the timing — just before 11 a.m. on Remembrance Sunday, the moment people across Britain hold services in memory of those killed in wars.Jackson said investigators had not found a link to remembrance events, “but it is a line of inquiry we are pursuing.”“Although the motivation for this incident is yet to be understood, given all the circumstances, it has been declared a terrorist incident,” he said at a press briefing.He said the passenger had been picked up by the cab a 10-minute drive away and asked to be taken to the hospital, where the explosion occurred. The driver, named locally as David Perry, managed to escape from the car. He was treated in hospital and released.Police said officers had searched two addresses in the city linked to the passenger and found “significant items” at one of them,Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson said the taxi driver locked the doors of his cab so the passenger couldn’t leave. The police did not confirm that account.“The taxi driver, in his heroic efforts, has managed to divert what could have been an absolutely awful disaster at the hospital,” Anderson told the BBC.The prime minister also said the driver appeared to have behaved “with the incredible presence of mind and bravery.”Nick Aldworth, a former senior terrorism investigator in Britain, said the taxi appeared to have sustained “a lot of fire damage with very little blast damage.”He said that “whatever was in that vehicle was either a low yield or didn’t work properly, or possibly an incendiary. So I think it’s very much open to debate at the moment about what has happened.”Britain’s official threat level from terrorism stands at “substantial,” the middle rung on a five-point scale, meaning an attack is likely. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre sets the threat level based on intelligence about international terrorism at home and overseas."

""That will be one of the things we look to find out.""Landsberg didn't elaborate on the significance of the runway change but said it would be a focus of the investigation.NTSB investigators said they hope a cockpit voice recorder helps them answer that question, but they have been unable to recover it yet since the part of the plane where it's located is still underwater in the St. Johns River. Investigators also plan to interview the pilots, Landsberg said.Investigators have retrieved the flight data recorder.Landsberg said the plane recently had been in maintenance, and logs showed a left-hand thrust reverser that was inoperative.Thrust reversers are used to divert thrust from the engine, but they typically aren't used in calculating a plane's performance, Landsberg said.According to a Purdue University College of Engineering description, reverse thrust can be used to help an aircraft come to a stop.There were no serious injuries on the flight from a military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, although almost two dozen of the 143 passengers and crew members sought medical attention for minor injuries.The NTSB investigators are still deciding whether to relocate the plane off the base, which would require the use of a barge.Divers on Sunday were sent into the plane's cargo area to search and remove a few pets that they had been unable to be rescued because of safety concerns. The investigators didn't say outright whether the animals were dead, but the pets would have been submerged for almost two days. (Except the headline, the copy has not been edited by IndiaTVNews.com)"

He said investigators believe the man was solely responsible for the attack, which happened around 2:30 p.m., and that he was gone by the time officers arrived.Four of the five people who were wounded at the business were hospitalized in critical condition, authorities said. During the manhunt for the suspect, he shot and wounded a state trooper, who was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, the Texas Department of Public Safety said on Twitter.Grimes County Sheriff Don Sowell said about two hours after the attack, the suspect was arrested in Bedias, a tiny community about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Bryan.Investigators were still trying to determine the motive for the attack, authorities said.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sent agents and dogs to the shooting scene, said spokesman Deon Washington. Police asked people to stay away from the business during the investigation.Bryan is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Houston and is near Texas A&M University. With more than 86,000 residents, it is the seat of Brazos County.A person who answered the phone at Kent Moore Cabinets’ headquarters in Bryan said she couldn’t provide any information on the shooting. The company, which makes custom cabinets, has design centers in nearly a dozen Texas cities and employs more than 600 people, according to its website.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott offered prayers for shooting victims and their families.“I have been working closely with the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Rangers as they assist local law enforcement on a swift response to this criminal act.

The team's study, published in the journal Nature Communications, noted a decline in self-reports of smell and taste changes as early as five days after lockdown enforcement, with faster declines reported in countries that adopted the most stringent lockdown measures.""In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have taken drastic measures to prevent their intensive care units from becoming overwhelmed with patients,"" said study co-author John Hayes, professor of food science at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in the US.""Our research suggests that an increase in the incidence of sudden smell and taste change in the general population may indicate that COVID-19 is spreading,"" Hayes said.The researchers believe the findings could help decision-makers take important measures at the local level, either in catching new outbreaks sooner, or in guiding the relaxation of local lockdowns, given the strong impact of lockdown on economic and social activities.In the study, the scientists used data from the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research survey -- a global, crowd-sourced online study deployed in more than 35 languages.The team also particularly assessed data from the French government -- which beginning on May 7, 2020, has been categorising various geographical areas of the country as red or green, depending on their COVID-19 prevalence.Compared to green areas, they said the red areas were characterised by higher active circulation of the virus, higher levels of pressure on hospitals and reduced capacity to test new cases.The researchers then compared data from France with data from Italy and the UK, each of which implemented lockdown measures at different times and with different levels of stringency.""Our primary aim was to test the association between self-reported smell and taste changes and indicators of pressure in hospitals, such as COVID-related hospitalisations, critical care resuscitation unit admissions and mortality rates, for each French administrative region over the last three months,"" said Veronica Pereda-Loth, a study co-author from the Universite Paul Sabatier Toulouse III in France.""Our secondary aim was to examine temporal relationships between the peak of smell and taste changes in the population and the peak of COVID-19 cases and the application of lockdown measures,"" Pereda-Loth said.The study found that smell and taste changes were better correlated with the number of COVID-19 admissions to hospitals than France's current governmental indicators, which look at the ratio of ER consultations for suspicion of COVID-19 to general ER consultations.According to the scientists, the peak onset of changes in smell/taste appeared four days after lockdown measures were implemented.In contrast, they said the governmental indicator based on ER consultations peaked 11 days after the lockdown.""Our findings are consistent with emerging data showing that COVID-19-related changes in smell and taste occur in the first few days after infection,"" Hayes said.""They suggest that self-reports of smell and taste changes are closely associated with hospital overload and are early markers of the spread of infection of SARS-CoV-2,"" he added.The scientists believe potential outbreaks and the short-term efficacy of a lockdown could be monitored by tracking changes in smell and taste in the population. "

8c20d5b10f97c2d63b75e219e90f0f94,"George Bush warns of domestic extremism, appeals to ‘nation I know’.  Warning that the nation was falling into division and extremism, former President George W. Bush appealed Saturday for a return to the spirit of cooperation that emerged- almost instantaneously- after the 9/11 attacks 20 years ago.Delivering the keynote address at the national memorial to the victims of Flight 93, who forced down their airplane hijacked by al-Qaida terrorists before it could be used as a weapon against the nation’s capital, Bush warned of “violence that gathers within.”“There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home,” he said. “But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit. And it is our continuing duty to confront them.”Bush’s warning came barely eight months after the violent insurrection at the US Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. It marked some of Bush’s sharpest criticism of that attack and appeared to be an implicit criticism of Trump’s brand of politics.Bush lamented that “so much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear and resentment.”He admitted he had no easy solutions. Instead, he channeled the heroism of the Flight 93 victims, and the determined spirit of a wounded nation to emerge from the tragedy stronger.“On America’s day of trial and grief, I saw millions of people instinctively grab for a neighbor’s hand and rally to the cause of one another,” Bush said. “That is the America I know.”He added that in the aftermath of the attacks Islamophobia, nativism or selfishness could have risen to the fore, but the country rejected them, and said, “That is the nation I know.”“This is not mere nostalgia, it is the truest version of ourselves,” Bush said. “It is what we have been, and what we can be again.”Bush’s appeal for unity drew plaudits from President Joe Biden, who visited Shanksville not long after Bush spoke, having watched his speech aboard Air Force One on the flight from 9/11 commemoration events in New York.“I thought that President Bush made a really good speech today,” Biden said. “Genuinely.”Biden too has prioritized national unity, telling reporters Saturday, “That’s the thing that’s going to affect our well-being more than anything else.”\   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

HIV rates among injection drug users increased by 21 per cent during 2019, followed by 3.7 per cent among homosexuals and 3.8 per cent in sex workers,"" the paper reported the UN report as saying.The UN report on the country's HIV infections came amidst nearly 800 people tested positive for the infection in Sindh province's Larkana district since April this year.Health officials had attributed the cause to the use of unsanitary equipment, unsafe blood transfusion and rampant malpractice often at the hands of quacks.""Globally, 37.9 million people are infected with HIV out of which 13.3 million have access to antiretroviral therapy, which is used to treat the infectious disease,"" the report said.According to statistics gathered by the UN and the World Health Organization, since 1985, a total of 25 million people lost the battle against HIV globally.In recent years, government awareness campaigns around the world helped reduce the number of HIV cases transmitted through drug use.However, awareness campaigns were mostly missing from the radar in Pakistan, the paper reported.Pakistan’s first HIV case surfaced 34 years ago in 1985. Since then, the country has witnessed a dangerous surge in the number of infected patients, partly because of the lack of a coherent national policy to prevent the disease from spreading, the report said.ALSO READ: Uttar Pradesh to get first toilet for transgenders ALSO READ: Transgender Persons bill passed in Lok Sabha  "

498c1c1bc1851b999522f908e1b1a26e,"The Trump administration's restrictive immigration policies have led to massive increase in the rejection of petitions for H-1B visas The Trump administration's restrictive immigration policies have led to massive increase in the rejection of petitions for H-1B visas with the highest denial rate among major Indian IT companies, according to a study by an American think-tank. The study by the National Foundation for American Policy, based on data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) showed that denial rates for H-1B petitions, popular among Indian IT professionals, have quadrupled from just six per cent in 2015 to 24 per cent in the third quarter of the current fiscal.The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. The study reflects that denial rate for H-1B visas is highest among major Indian IT companies, thus giving credence to charges that Indian companies are being unduly targeted by the administration of President Donald Trump.For instance, the denial rate of H-1B petitions for initial employment for Amazon, Microsoft, Intel and Google in 2015 was just one per cent. In 2019, the same increased respectively to six, eight, seven and three per cent. The denial rate for Apple remained the same at two per cent. During the same period, the denial rate jumped from four per cent to 41 per cent for Tech Mahindra, from six per cent to 34 per cent for Tata Consultancy Services, from seven per cent to 53 per cent for Wipro and from just two per cent to 45 per cent for Infosys, the study showed.At least 12 companies that provide professional or IT services to other US companies, including Accenture, Capgemini and others, had denial rates of over 30 per cent through the first three quarters of fiscal 2019. Most of these companies had denial rates between two per cent and seven per cent as recently as in 2015, it said. The denial rate for H-1B petitions for continuing employment was also high for Indian IT companies. For Tech Mahindra, it increased from two per cent to 16 per cent during the same period, while that of Wipro increased from four per cent to 19 per cent, and Infosys from one per cent to 29 per cent, the study showed.On the other hand, the denial rates for H-1B petitions for continuing employment among major American companies were low - Amazon (from one per cent to three per cent), Microsoft (remained at two per cent), Intel (from one per cent to three per cent), Apple (remained at one per cent) and for Google, it increased from 0.4 per cent in 2015 to one per cent in 2019. Noting that between 2015 and 2019, the denial rate for new H-1B petitions for initial employment quadrupled from six to 24 per cent, the National Foundation for American Policy said to put this in perspective, between 2010 and 2015, the denial rate for ""initial"" H-1B petitions never exceeded eight per cent, while today the rate is three times higher.""A key goal of the Trump administration - achieved through memos and policy changes - has been to make it more difficult for well-educated foreign nationals to work in America in science and engineering fields,"" the foundation said. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, USCIS adjudicators denied 24 per cent of H-1B petitions for ""initial"" employment and 12 per cent of H-1B petitions for ""continuing"" employment, it said.The 12 per cent denial rate for continuing employment is also historically high. It was only three per cent in 2015, the think-tank said. ""Based on how the agency processes cases, this data suggests the environment has not improved for employers,"" Lynden Melmed, a partner at Berry Appleman & Leiden and former chief counsel for USCIS, said.""'Cream of the crop' cases would have been approved during that time period, but cases where the government issued a Request for Evidence would likely not show up in that data set because they would not be decided until much later,"" he said. A research by Britta Glennon, assistant professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, found that ""restrictive H-1B policies could not only be exporting more jobs and businesses to countries like Canada, but they also could be making the US' innovative capacity fall behind"".In response to being unable to hire high-skilled foreign nationals, US companies increase their hiring overseas, which causes more innovation by foreign nationals to take place in other countries, benefiting those nations, the think-tank said. H-1B visa restrictions, such as those now being implemented by the administration, push jobs outside the United States and lead to less innovation in America, it said. In 2017, President Trump issued the 'Buy American and Hire American' executive order, which he promised would reform the high-skilled immigration programme to create higher wages and employment rates for American workers.Since then the USCIS has been denying and delaying record numbers of H-1B visa petitions, industry insiders say. In January this year, Trump tweeted that his administration would overhaul the policies on H-1B visa and will encourage talented and highly-skilled people to pursue career options in the US.(PTI copy only headline changed)ALSO READ| Riyadh restructures visa system, cancels fee for repeat UmrahALSO READ| Bad news for US visa seekers.

f0c002a32e3180ef2ca83b167c8afcb8,"People wear masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic in downtown Mexico CityBarring an unforeseen breakthrough, intelligence agencies won’t be able to conclude whether COVID-19 was spread by animal-to-human transmission or leaked from a lab, officials said Friday in releasing a fuller version of their review into the origins of the pandemic. The paper issued by the Director of National Intelligence elaborates on findings released in August of a 90-day review ordered by President Joe Biden. That review said that US intelligence agencies were divided on the origins of the virus but that analysts do not believe the virus was developed as a bioweapon and that most agencies believe the virus was not genetically engineered.China has resisted global pressure to cooperate fully with investigations into the pandemic or provide access to genetic sequences of coronaviruses kept at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which remains a subject of speculation for its research and reported safety problems. Biden launched the review amid growing momentum for the theory — initially broadly dismissed by experts — that the virus leaked from the Wuhan lab. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters long argued that a lab leak was possible as they sought to deflect criticism of his handling of the pandemic.China remains an exceedingly difficult place for intelligence operations and has fought back against allegations that it mishandled the emergence of the pandemic, which has killed 5 million people worldwide. Senior officials involved in the full report’s drafting said they hoped it would better inform the public about the challenges of determining the virus’s origins.“We don’t think we’re one or two reports away from being able to understand it,” said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.The full report notes that the Wuhan Institute of Virology “previously created chimeras, or combinations, of SARS-like coronaviruses, but this information does not provide insight into whether SARS Cov-2 was genetically engineered by the WIV.”Information that lab researchers sought medical treatment for a respiratory illness in November 2019 “is not diagnostic of the pandemic’s origins,” the report said.And allegations that China launched the virus as a bioweapon were dismissed because their proponents “do not have direct access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” are making scientifically invalid claims or are accused of spreading disinformation, the report said.Four agencies within the intelligence community said with low confidence that the virus was initially transmitted from an animal to a human. A fifth intelligence agency believed with moderate confidence that the first human infection was linked to a lab.Prior to writing the report, analysts conducted what the report describes as a “Team A/Team B” debate to try to strengthen or weaken each hypothesis.The report identifies types of data that investigators still want China to provide access to, including records and tissue samples from several markets in Wuhan, including the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, Qiyimen Live Animal Market, Dijiao Outdoor Pet Market and others. Scientists originally believed the virus emerged from animals sold at the Huanan market, which they have since ruled out.Confirming with 100% certainty the origin of a virus is often not fast, easy or always even possible.In the case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS — a disease caused by a beta coronavirus, like the current coronavirus — researchers first identified the virus in February 2003. Later that year, scientists discovered the likely intermediary hosts: Himalayan palm civets found at live-animal markets in Guangdong, China. But it wasn’t until 2017 that researchers traced the likely original source of the virus to bat caves in China’s Yunnan province.(With inputs from AP)Also Read | India achieves 105 crore COVID 19 vaccinations: Union Health Minister   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_6527269608 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/10/0_7k8893ta/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_7k8893ta_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""India remains steadfast partner in global efforts to combat Covid: PM Modi"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""2252"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_6527269608 = ''; jwsetup_6527269608(); function jwsetup_6527269608() { jwvidplayer_6527269608 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_6527269608"").setup(jwconfig_6527269608); jwvidplayer_6527269608.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_6527269608, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_7k8893ta\"", ns_st_pr=\""India remains steadfast partner in global efforts to combat Covid: PM Modi\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""India remains steadfast partner in global efforts to combat Covid: PM Modi\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""India remains steadfast partner in global efforts to combat Covid: PM Modi\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-10-22\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-10-22\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/10/0_7k8893ta/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_6527269608.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_6527269608.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_6527269608.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_6527269608.stop(); jwvidplayer_6527269608.remove(); jwvidplayer_6527269608 = ''; jwsetup_6527269608(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_6527269608.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_6527269608.stop(); jwvidplayer_6527269608.remove(); jwvidplayer_6527269608 = ''; jwsetup_6527269608(); return; }); jwvidplayer_6527269608.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6527269608.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6527269608.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6527269608.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6527269608.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6527269608.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

Their assessment is based on reports from IS detainees and refugees in northern Syria that emerged months after the airstrike.Earlier, Russia had claimed that it killed the reclusive leader, who was not seen in public since declaring the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)'s caliphate from the Iraqi city of Mosul in July 2014, in an air strike on a meeting of senior Isil commanders near Raqqa on May 28.However, there was no evidence to back up the claim and the same was questioned by the US-led coalition against Isil at that time. Baghdadi has made only one public appearance in July 2014 at the al-Nuri Mosque in Mosul, which was retaken by Iraqi security forces in June 2017. Islamic State has since then released various audio messages that it claims to be of Baghdadi."

We believe that it should become a very good reinforcement for our countries' economies when they're coming out of the crisis and resume economic operations,"" Lavrov said after the meeting.The BRICS represents over 3. 6 billion people, or half of the world population and has a combined GDP of USD 16.6 trillion.In his address, External Affairs Minster S Jaishankar conveyed to the BRICS that it is important to provide support to businesses to tide over the crisis and ensure that livelihoods are not lost.He said the influential grouping has an important role to play in shaping the global economic and political architecture.Jaishankar noted that the pandemic and the subsequent challenge highlighted the need for reform of the multilateral systems.All the BRICS member nations are reeling under the pandemic.Jaishankar emphasised that the pandemic is not only posing a great risk to the health and well being of humanity but is also severely impacting global economy and output by disruption of global trade and supply chains, the Ministry of External Affairs said.""Economic activity across sectors has been negatively impacted leading to loss of jobs and livelihoods.He emphasised that we need to provide support to businesses, especially MSMEs, to tide over the crisis and ensure livelihoods are not lost,"" the MEA said in a release.It said the minister pointed out that the efficacy of traditional medicine systems to strengthen immunity should be recognised and that BRICS should support these efforts.This video conference was convened in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and the discussions primarily focused on ways to deal with the crisis, its impact and the possible response by the grouping.The conference also discussed the activities to be undertaken under Russian BRICS Chairmanship in 2020.It was chaired by Lavrov.Besides Jaishankar, the conference was attended by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo and South Africa's Minister for International Cooperation Grace Naledi Pandor.The MEA said Jaishankar emphasised that the ""current challenge underlines all the more the need for reform of multilateral systems and that reformed multilateralism was the way forward. He referred to the centrality of development and growth in the global agenda.""He also highlighted the initiatives and various ""decisive steps"" taken early by India in the wake of the pandemic including through Aarogya Setu Citizen App and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package, according to the MEA.The Aarogya Setu app, developed by government-run National Informatics Centre, users know if they have come in contact with any positive coronavirus patient and ways to avoid the infection.""He highlighted that much before the outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by WHO, India instituted measures to check coronavirus,"" the MEA said.Jaishankar apprised the BRICS foreign ministers about India's initiative to coordinate efforts to contain COVID-19 in South Asia, and creation of COVID-19 emergency response fund by the SAARC countries.""India is providing pharma assistance to nearly 85 nations, including many countries in Africa, on a grant basis, to support their response to the pandemic.

South Korea says it will soon announce a guideline for hospitals on experimental coronavirus treatments using donated blood from patients who survived.As many as 51 COVID-19 patients who had recovered and left quarantine have tested positive for coronavirus once again. Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), on Monday, said that 51 people from Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang province have tested positive for COVI-19 in 'relatively short time' after their release from quarantine. KCDC Director-General Jeong Eun-Kyeong said that the virus was likely reactivated. Daegu has been the epicenter for South Korea's COVID-19 outbreak.Health authorities in the region told Yonhap news agency that a team of investigators has been sent to Daegu to conduct an epidemiological investigation into the cases.Earlier it was reported by local Chinese media that 10 per cent of coronavirus patients in Wuhan who recovered and left quarantine, re-triggered the virus. Wang Wei, the president of Tongji Hospital where the first COVID-19 case was identified, told state broadcaster CCTV that those who tested positive did not have any symptoms and none of their close contacts had been infected.On April 8, China lifted the 76-day lockdown inflicted on Wuhan, where the mysterious new strain of coronavirus first emerged. As of now, close to 1.5 million people worldwide have contracted coronavirus and over 82,000 people have died. "

9ff6522f3d0f9f6158e481ffbeafe899,"Interpol issues wanted notice to Lebanon for ex-Nissan chairman Carlos GhosnInterpol issued a wanted notice Thursday for former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn, who jumped bail in Japan and fled to Lebanon rather than face trial on financial misconduct charges in an escape that has baffled and embarrassed authorities.Lebanese Justice Minister Albert Serhan told The Associated Press in an interview that Lebanon “will carry out its duties,” suggesting for the first time that the automotive titan may be brought in for questioning. But he said Ghosn entered the country on a legal passport, and he appeared to cast doubt on the possibility Lebanon would hand Ghosn over to Japan.Interpol issued what is known as a Red Notice, or a request to law enforcement agencies worldwide that they locate and provisionally arrest a fugitive. A Red Notice is not an arrest warrant and does not require Lebanon to arrest Ghosn.Shortly afterward, Ghosn issued a statement — his second this week — seeking to distance his Lebanese wife and family from any role in his escape.“The allegations in the media that my wife Carole and other members of my family played a role in my departure from Japan are false and misleading. I alone organized my departure. My family played no role,” he said.Ghosn, who is Lebanese and also holds French and Brazilian passports, was set to go on trial in Japan in April. He arrived in Lebanon on Monday via Turkey and hasn’t been seen in public since. In a statement, he said he had fled to avoid “political persecution.” Lebanese authorities have said that he entered legally on a French passport.Ghosn’s sudden arrival in Beirut shocked Japan and confounded authorities. How he was able to flee Japan, avoiding the tight surveillance he was under while free on 1.5 billion yen ($14 million) bail, is still a mystery.Ghosn, who grew up in Beirut and frequently visited, is a national hero to many in this Mediterranean country with close ties to senior politicians and business stakes in a number of companies. People take special pride in the auto industry icon, who is credited with leading a spectacular turnaround at Nissan beginning in the late 1990s and rescuing the automaker from near-bankruptcy.Even as he fell from grace internationally, politicians across the board mobilized in his defense after his arrest in Japan, with some suggesting his detention may be part of a political or business-motivated conspiracy.Serhan said prosecutors will summon Ghosn and listen to him, and “at a later stage if there are any measures to be taken, then the precautionary measures will be taken.”“We are a country of law and respect the law and ... I can confirm that the Lebanese state will implement the law,” the justice minister said. “The prosecution will not stay cross-armed regarding this Red Notice.”At the same time, Serhan said that Lebanon has not received an official extradition request from Japan, and he noted that the two countries do not have an extradition treaty.“Mr. Ghosn arrived to Lebanon as any ordinary citizen. ... Lebanese authorities have no security or judiciary charges against him. He entered the border like any other Lebanese using a legal passport,” he added.Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency said Thursday that Turkish authorities had detained seven people as part of an investigation into how Ghosn fled to Lebanon via Istanbul. The private DHA news agency reported that those detained are four pilots, a cargo company manager and two airport workers.In Japan, prosecutors on Thursday raided Ghosn’s Tokyo home. Japanese media showed investigators entering the home, which was Ghosn’s third residence in Tokyo since he was first arrested a year ago. Authorities have searched each one.Tokyo prosecutors and police did not immediately comment. Government offices in Japan are closed this week for the New Year’s holiday.Ghosn’s lawyers in Japan said they had no knowledge of the escape and they had all his passports. Ghosn has French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship.Japanese public broadcaster NHK TV, without identifying sources, reported Thursday that Ghosn had two French passports.Earlier, Japanese reports said there were no official records in Japan of Ghosn’s departure, but a private jet had left from a regional airport to Turkey.The Hurriyet newspaper said the plane carrying Ghosn landed at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport at 5:30 a.m. on Dec. 29. Ghosn was not registered upon landing and was smuggled onboard another plane that left for Lebanon, the paper reported.Ghosn, who was charged in Japan with under-reporting his future compensation and breach of trust, has repeatedly asserted his innocence, saying authorities trumped-up charges to prevent a possible fuller merger between Nissan Motor Co. and Renault."
88159369224ea63775faf9b8c40a8bfc,"Security at Cameroon Presidential electionCameroon voted on Sunday in a presidential election marked by deadly violence in the country's English-speaking regions and the cancellation of voting in at least one affected area over security fears.Cameroon has been rocked by a separatist insurgency from within its anglophone minority, who number around five million, since last October with many thousands displaced which will affect turnout in English communities.They accuse likely election winner President Paul Biya, 85, of oppression and are concentrated in the northwest and southwest of the majority-francophone country.Polls closed at 1700 GMT and the final results must legally be announced within 15 days.After voting got under way Sunday, security forces shot dead three suspected separatists who had allegedly fired at passersby from a motorcycle in Bamenda, the main city in the northwest region, a local official said.In Buea, capital of the southwest, three separatists of the so-called Ambazonia Republic separatist movement were gunned down on Friday and a priest was executed by soldiers on Thursday, according to witnesses.Gunfire was heard in the town throughout the day and a car belonging to the state-run Cameroon Tribune newspaper came under fire.The army confirmed that voting could not be held in at least one district of the southwest, Lysoka village.""This area is dangerous. It's calm but it can erupt at any moment,"" a police officer told AFP at the scene.A heavily-armed convoy had attempted to deliver ballot boxes, signs and voting papers to the village but commanders decided it was too risky and withdrew.Separatists hold a ""significant"" amount of territory, according to the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank, and had threatened to disrupt the vote.The violence in the anglophone regions has killed at least 420 civilians, 175 members of the security forces and an unknown number of separatists, according to the ICG.Sunday's vote, in which 6.5 million voters were eligible to cast ballots, followed a last-minute opposition unity bid to dislodge Biya, one of Africa's longest-serving rulers.Biya and his wife Chantal, who wore a matching canary yellow skirt, jacket and handbag along with her signature brown bouffant hair, voted in the Bastos public school in the capital Yaounde surrounded by heavily-armed soldiers.""The election campaign was conducted peacefully... as president, it would be satisfying to be reelected to see that the people trust me,"" Biya told journalists as he left the voting booth and returned to his Mercedes-Maybach limousine.Voter Ulrich, 26, said he wanted a president ""who can keep the country peaceful"" after casting his ballot at the same polling station as Biya.The far north of the oil and rubber-producing country is also mired in insecurity, as Nigeria-based Boko Haram fighters mount attacks despite US efforts to equip and train Cameroon's military to battle the jihadists.Tens of thousands have been displaced by that conflict, and 246,000 people have fled their homes in the southwest and 25,000 have left the country altogether for Nigeria, according to UN figures.The sheer number of displaced people, who it is thought will have been unable to cast ballots because of hometown voting requirements, would likely depress turnout, analysts said.""As expected, turnout in the English regions has been particularly low with virtually all the returns we have seen suggesting less than five percent,"" said ICG analyst Hans de Marie Heungoup.Only a handful of voters cast ballots at a polling station in downtown Buea, according to the AFP team at the scene.That could favour Biya's bid for another seven- year term as anglophones have traditionally backed the Social Democratic Front (SDF) party of his rival Joshua Osih.In a rare coordinated political manoeuvre, a key opposition frontrunner, Maurice Kamto, agreed late Friday to a unity deal between his Movement for the Rebirth of Cameroon (MRC) and the People's Development Front (FDP), meaning he stood for both parties.However, it is unclear whether the eleventh-hour deal, which Osih and other opposition barons did not join, will have swayed the vote -- especially as voters were still able to cast ballots for the FDP candidate.Kamto's MRC previously warned that a ""massive fraud"" was under way to secure a Biya win.""We're not preparing for war, but wherever there is fraud, there will be a firm response,"" said MRC spokesman Paul-Eric Kingue.The government hit back saying that it would ""not tolerate any disorder before, during or after the presidential vote"".The opposition has long accused the authorities of giving unfair advantage to Biya who enjoys support from Washington and Paris."

Zhuhai, Huizhou and Dongguan in China's south Guangdong province close to Hong Kong have announced cash rewards for people who report suspected illegal crossings from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) amid reports of people fleeing to the mainland by road and sea to escape the spread of the contagion, state-run Global Times reported on Saturday.Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, reported 6,063 infections in addition to 7,400 preliminary-positive cases on Saturday, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper reported. With the death of 15 patients, the coronavirus-related death toll reached 280. The latest infections brought the overall tally to 46,763 cases.Such was the caseload that hundreds of suspected COVID-19 patients, who were forced to wait outside public hospitals for admission over the past few days, had now been moved indoors. As the situation deteriorated, reports say Hong Kong is busy converting auditoriums and dormitories to accommodate surging cases even as it plans to build a Wuhan style makeshift hospital to accommodate hundreds of patients.Chinese cities Zhuhai and Dongguan have announced cash rewards capped at 100,000 yuan (USD 15,785) for tip-offs for suspected smuggling of Hong Kongers by vehicle or boat. The reward for reporting group smuggling is 30,000 yuan (over USD 4,600) and 10,000 yuan (over USD 1,500) for individuals illegally crossing the border, according to official notices.Chenzhou and Nan'an cities also released similar notices against the backdrop of five confirmed COVID-19 cases being found among 15 who were smuggled from Hong Kong to the mainland via Zhuhai by boat on February 14. Upon arrival in Zhuhai, some travelled to other mainland cities, leading to flare-ups in cases -- two each in Chenzhou and Guangzhou and one in Shanghai, the Global Times reported.As the situation deteriorated in Hong Kong, China deployed Wang Hesheng, director of the country’s newly-established National Administration of Disease Prevention and Control, who was earlier sent to Wuhan where the coronavirus first emerged in December 2019, to bring the situation under control. Wang took charge at the pandemic control outpost in Shenzhen on Wednesday, attending a high-level coordination group meeting, presided over by the central government’s top official for Hong Kong Xia Baolong, the Post reported.On the same day, Chinese President Xi Jinping instructed the Hong Kong government to shoulder the “main responsibility” of tackling its exponentially growing coronavirus outbreak and to “mobilise all forces and resources” to protect lives and ensure stability. Beijing’s calling in a “big-gun” like Wang is indicative of the top leadership’s grave concerns over the pandemic situation in Hong Kong. The worry is that it is getting “rapidly out of hand and posing a major risk of spillover to the mainland,” said Junfei Wu, a researcher at the Hong Kong China Economic and Cultural Development Association.“With a daily increment of over 3,000 (cases), Hong Kong’s total confirmed infections, now standing at 40,000 plus, are set to surpass the total in the (2020) Wuhan outbreak. There is certainly a need to bring Wang, who has prior experience to contain an outbreak of such a scale, to the frontline,” Wu told the Post. The situation in Hong Kong is so grave that the election for the chief executive of HKSAR, originally scheduled for March 27, is postponed to May 8, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Friday.Also Read | Delhi logs 635 fresh Covid-19 cases today, positivity rate at 1.12%Also Read | Covaxin to be evaluated as COVID-19 vaccine candidate in US, says Bharat Biotech"

With the new fatalities, the total death toll in the country has crossed 28,000. Meanwhile, nine states in the US, which has the worlds maximum coronavirus caseload, have emerged as outliers with less than 1,000 cases and less than 30 cases per day at a time. Government relief checks began arriving in Americans bank accounts as the economic damage piled up.Predictive models from the University of Washington, used by the White House, are projecting a peak death toll of more than 68,000 by August 2020 assuming full social distancing in place.Laying out the latest data, White House coronavirus co-ordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said some states like California, Washington State and Oregon ""never really had a peak"". Birx credited the blunted infection curves of these areas to strong and early mitigation efforts. Meanwhile, hospitalizations and intubations from the outbreak are levelling off in New York, the epicentre of the US outbreak. On Tuesday, New York recorded 752 deaths sending the state total to more than 11,000 in just over a month. Rhode Island and Providence, sandwiched between what Birx calls ""two incredible hotspots"", are becoming new areas of concern. Birx reminded the American people again about the highly contagious nature of the COVID19 virus and asked them to shun social gatherings. ""To all of you that are out there that would like to join together and just have that dinner party for 20, don't do it yet"", she urged. At the same briefing, US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Purdue assured Americans that there is ""plenty of food"" for everyone in the country. ""I want to be clear, the bare store shelves that you may see in some cities in the country are a demand issue, not a supply issue"", he said. US President Donald Trump is keen to open up the economy as soon as possible and Governors who disagree with Trump's messaging are banding together to draft their own plans. Health experts around the world are warning more loudly than ever that halting social-distancing measures just when the infection curve is being blunted could result in a deadly second wave of the COVID-19 disease. The trinity of testing at scale, isolation and contact tracing is essential for the economy to get back to some kind of functional place, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, America's most respected infectious diseases doctor on the White House task force. The coronavirus pandemic began in China in 2019 and has killed nearly 127,000 people till date.Also Read | Coronavirus cases approach 21 lakh-mark; death toll stands at 134,603Also Read | Donald Trump threatens to adjourn Congress if Senate does not confirm his nominees​"

They were rescued from the lake, where they had gone swimming, by a police officer on Saturday. According to the Bryan police, an officer patrolling the lake was flagged down by a person who said two people swimming in the lake were in distress. The person who alerted the officer was with the two students, both in their 20s. He had managed to rescue one of them, while the police officer rescued the other one and treated both of them with CPR until medical help arrived, the police said. The students were identified as -- Shalini, and Nikhil Bhatia. They were taken to the CHI St. Joseph Hospital, where their condition is stated to be critical. It was not immediately clear as to why they were swimming in the severe weather. India's Consul-General in Houston has been monitoring the two students' medical needs and the situation closely. According to the consulate office, Nikhil Bhatia is yet to show signs of improvement, while Shalini showed some improvement today for the first time since her arrival at the hospital. Nikhil's mother, Dr. Suman Bhatia, has arrived from India and was assisted by the consulate office amidst the devastating flood situations here after being received at the Dallas airport. Whereas, Shalini's brother will be arriving tomorrow, the consulate said. Around 13 million people were battling ""catastrophic"" flooding and torrential rains in the storm-ravaged Texas where Hurricane Harvey has wreaked havoc, turning streets into raging rivers and claiming at least five lives. Meteorologists have forecast that the historic rainfall will dump up to 50 inches by Wednesday.

The students were being provided food and other supplies by the Indian-American community in the area.

b2a8db5f03e67da4ea3db7f4420ca328,"Citing national security concerns, the White House on Friday formally notified the House intelligence committee that President Donald Trump is “unable” to declassify a memo drafted by Democrats that counters GOP allegations about abuse of government surveillance powers in the FBI’s Russia probe.White House counsel Don McGahn said in a letter to the committee that the memo contains “numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages” and asked the intelligence panel to revise the memo with the help of the Justice Department. He said Trump is still “inclined” to release the memo in the interest of transparency if revisions are made.Related Stories US President Donald Trump dials PM Narendra Modi: Here's what the two leaders discussedDonald Trump's immigration framework to end green card backlog: White House Donald Trump signs budget deal, bringing end to second US shutdown of 2018The president’s rejection of the Democratic memo is in contrast to his enthusiastic embrace of releasing the Republican document, which he pledged before reading to make public. The president declassified the document last week, allowing its publication in full over the objections of the Justice Department.The top Democrat on the intelligence panel, California Rep. Adam Schiff, criticized Trump for treating the two documents differently, saying the president is now seeking revisions by the same committee that produced the original Republican memo. Still, Schiff said, Democrats “look forward to conferring with the agencies to determine how we can properly inform the American people about the misleading attack on law enforcement by the GOP.”House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi was less measured, saying the White House move is “part of a dangerous and desperate pattern of cover-up on the part of the president.” California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and has read the classified information both memos are based on, tweeted that Trump’s blocking the memo is “hypocrisy at its worst.”House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who produced the GOP memo, encouraged Democrats to accept the Justice Department’s recommendations and “make the appropriate technical changes and redactions.”Trump has said the GOP memo “vindicates” him in the ongoing Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. But congressional Democrats and Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, who helped draft the GOP memo, have said it shouldn’t be used to undermine the special counsel.Earlier Friday, White House spokesman Raj Shah said Trump was discussing the Democratic document with the White House counsel’s office, FBI Director Christopher Wray and another top Justice Department official.The president had until Saturday to decide whether to allow the classified material to become public after the House intelligence committee voted Monday to release it. Republicans backed releasing the memo in committee with a unanimous vote, but several said they thought it should be redacted. Ryan also said he thought the Democratic document should be released.In declining to declassify the document, the White House also sent lawmakers a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Wray, as well as a marked-up copy of the memo, laying out portions it considers too sensitive to make public. Among those passages are some that the Justice Departments says could compromise intelligence sources and methods, ongoing investigations and national security if disclosed.Democrats who wrote the memo say it disputes many claims in the GOP memo, which accused the FBI and Justice Department of abusing their surveillance powers in obtaining a secret warrant to monitor former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page.The White House message caps off a week in which Republicans and Democrats on the committee have publicly fought, with the panel now erecting a wall to separate feuding Republican and Democratic staffers who had long sat side by side.The disagreements have escalated over the last year as Democrats have charged that Republicans aren’t taking the panel’s investigation into Russian election meddling seriously enough. They say the GOP memo, led by Nunes, is designed as a distraction from the probe, which is looking into whether Trump’s campaign was in any way connected to the Russian interference.Trump declassified the GOP-authored memo over the objections of the FBI, which said it had “grave concerns” about the document’s accuracy.In the Nunes’ memo, Republicans took aim at the FBI and the Justice Department over the use of information from former British spy Christopher Steele in obtaining a warrant to monitor Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The main allegation was that the FBI and Justice Department didn’t tell the court enough about Steele’s anti-Trump bias or that his work was funded in part by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee.They argued that the reliance on Steele’s material amounted to an improper politicization of the government’s surveillance powers.Democrats have countered that the GOP memo was inaccurate and a misleading collection of “cherry-picked” details.They noted that federal law enforcement officials had informed the court about the political origins of Steele’s work and that some of the former spy’s information was corroborated by the FBI. They also noted that there was other evidence presented to the court besides Steele’s information, though they have not provided details."
bcd5cef31e7b2687272c8f2e0edbee85,"Saudi oil giant Aramco announces world largest IPOSaudi Arabian state oil giant Saudi Aramco on Thursday priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the high end of the targeted range, a level that will allow the company to raise a record total of at least $25.6 billion. The company plans to sell 3 billion shares, or 1.5 per cent of its total shares, at a price of 32 Saudi riyals ($8.53) per share.This IPO's size gives Aramco a market valuation of $1.7 trillion, pushing it ahead of Apple ($1.17 trillion) as the world's most valuable publicly traded company, Efe news reported. Trading of Aramco's shares is expected to begin next week pending an announcement by Riyadh's stock exchange. Aramco had previously announced that its shares would not be offered in the United States, Australia, Canada or Japan.Saudi Arabia has pursued a commitment from wealthy Saudi citizens and regional allies to purchase shares as a gesture of solidarity and goodwill as opposed to an investment decision. Meanwhile, the kingdom's banks were directed to double the leverage limit for loans to investors looking to buy Aramco's shares. Compared to an average leverage-ratio limit for loans of 1 to 1, banks were allowed to lend to retail customers for this purpose at a 2-to-1 ratio.The company will offer 33.3 percent of the available shares (0.5 percent of Aramco's total shares) to retail investors, while the remaining 66.7 percent have been allocated for institutional investors. The IPO was 4.65 times oversubscribed, with total bids of $119 billion, according to sources close to the process.An additional 450 million Aramco shares could be sold under an over-allotment option for underwriters, which would bring the total amount raised to nearly $30 billion. The previous record IPO ($25 billion) was set in 2014 by Chinese online commerce company Alibaba Group Holding. Trading of the shares is expected to commence after all relevant legal requirements and procedures have been completed.The company plans to pay a base dividend of $75 billion in 2020. However, it has cautioned about investment risks that include fluctuating oil prices and the backlash faced by oil companies due to their role in climate change. The sale has been bolstered by Saudi Arabia's regional allies, whose participation was a relief to the kingdom after plans to market the IPO globally floundered.Proceeds from the IPO are needed as the kingdom aims to diversify its economy away from oil and implement domestic socio-economic reforms. Aramco's IPO plans were put on hold last year in preparation for Saudi capital market reforms. No information currently exists on where the IPO will be listed abroad. The IPO may encourage other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) state oil companies to carry out their own initial public offerings; however, Abu Dhabi-based ADNOC is expected to only list the shares of its subsidiaries.Aramco reported net income of $111.1 billion in 2018 and $46.9 billion in the first half of 2019. The company suffered a damaging drone and missile attack on some of its oil-processing facilities in September of this year.ALSO READ | China's defence budget increases 850 percent over 20 yearsALSO READ | Anti-Terrorism Court verdict in case against Imran on December 12"

The Indian troops intervened to stop the road as it posed a security risk to Chicken Neck, the narrow corridor connecting India with its north-eastern states. The standoff ended on August 28 following a mutual agreement under which China stopped the construction of the road and India withdrew its troops. The 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control between India and China covers from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh. When asked how Chinese military view its relations with its Indian counterpart in 2018 in the backdrop of the Doklam standoff, Col Ren said India should implement the border agreements and control its troops. ""We hope the Indian side can earnestly implement the relevant agreements reached between the two sides on the border issue and strictly control its border defence troops and do more for the positive development of China-India military-to-military relationship,"" he said. During the border talks, the first since the 73-day-long military standoff in Doklam, in Delhi on December 22 between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi, both sides stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability along the border, Ren said. ""As far as we know both sides have agreed that it is important to maintain peace stability along India-China border and create favourable conditions for further development of bilateral relationship, which has provided a good environment and good momentum for the continued enhancement of China and India relationship,"" he said. In terms of China and India military-to-military relationship, it is important to have strategic communication and push forward healthy development of ties between the two militaries, Col Ren said. ""We hope Indian side walk towards the same direction as the Chinese side and both sides can push forward the development of the relationship and jointly maintain the peace and stability along the China-India border which is in the interest of both sides,"" he said. About a recent incident in which an Indian drone crashed on the Chinese side in the Sikkim sector, Col Ren declined to reveal details and whether the parts of the drone recovered by Chinese troops have been handed back to India. ""It is our position that India should have learnt lesson from the incident,"" he said. On December 7, China had lodged a diplomatic protest with India claiming that an Indian drone has ""intruded"" into its airspace and crashed in the Sikkim section of the border which included Doklam. India has clarified that the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle had developed a technical snag and asked China to return it."
a0036fe49efc12e03a4e04c33f398f10,"Anti-government protesters gather near barriers set up by security forces to close Rasheed Street during ongoing protests in BaghdadGunmen in cars opened fire Friday in Baghdad’s Khilani Square. leaving at least 15 people dead and 60 wounded, Iraqi security and medical officials said. At least two of the dead were policemen. Protesters fearing for their lives ran from the plaza to nearby Tahrir Square and mosques to take cover. It wasn’t immediately clear who did the shooting. The attack came as anti-government demonstrators occupied parts of Jumhuriya, Sinak and Ahar bridges in a standoff with security forces. All the bridges lead to or near the heavily-fortified Green Zone, the seat of Iraq’s government.“We are under live fire now with an electric power cut, the wounded and martyrs are here and the bullets were fired in Sinak Bridge,” said one protester, who did not give their name for fear of retaliation.The attack came a day after a string of suspicious stabbing incidents targeting demonstrators left at least 13 wounded in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square, the epicenter of Iraq’s leaderless protest movement.Those attacks by unknown perpetrators occurred as demonstrators supporting political parties and Iran-backed militias withdrew from the Square . The incidents Thursday fueled paranoia among protesters, who immediately implemented self security measures to uncover saboteurs within the square.At least 400 people have died since the leaderless uprising shook Iraq on Oct. 1, with thousands of Iraqis taking to the streets in Baghdad and the predominantly Shiite southern Iraq decrying corruption, poor services, lack of jobs and calling for an end to the political system that was imposed after the 2003 U.S. invasion.Security forces dispersed crowds with live fire, tear gas and sonic bombs, leading to fatalities.Earlier, Iraq’s highest Shiite religious authority called for the formation of a new government within the allotted deadline, and without foreign interference, as the clock ticks down on lawmakers to select a new premier following the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi last week.Thousands of anti-government protesters from across southern Iraq had joined demonstrators in Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the protest movement in the capital, hours after the sermon, according to security officials.“We hope the head of the new government and it’s members are chosen within the constitutional deadline and according to the aspirations of the people and away from outside influence,” the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said in his weekly Friday sermon in the holy city of Najaf. The sermon is always delivered by a representative.He added that the Shiite religious establishment would not take part in the government formation process.Parliament had 15 days since his stepping down was formally recognized by lawmakers last Sunday to name a new nominee, per the constitution.Since the U.S. invasion of 2003, government formation in Iraq has been based on brokering consensus among political factions and their foreign allies, primarily the U.S. and Iran. President Barham Salih launched talks immediately after Abdul-Mahdi’s resignation by making rounds with different political blocs. Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force and the architect of its regional security apparatus, also came to Baghdad to meet with key officials.Lawmakers made headway in passing a key reform bill to change the membership of Iraq’s controversial Independent High Electoral Commission, the body tasked with overseeing polls, in a session Thursday night. Anti-government protesters consider IHEC a corrupt and partisan institution and its commissioners working in favor of political parties. The new law seeks to select commissioners primarily from the judiciary.Protesters are also calling for early elections and reforms to have a greater influence in electing their representatives.Al-Sistani, Iraq’s most powerful religious figure who’s opinion holds sway over Iraqis, also said peaceful protesters should increase their ranks and push out saboteurs, while respecting the role of the “indispensable” security forces.Following the sermon, thousands of protesters traveled to Baghdad from across southern Iraqi provinces and marched on Tahrir Square, including from Dhi Qar, Diwanieh, Karbala, Najaf, Babylon and Missan, security officials said, chanting the slogan “Sistani, we are his soldiers.”Also Read: US agency completes implementation of H-1B electronic registration process for 2021 cap seasonAlso Read: 3 dead, 8 injured after Saudi student opens fire at US naval station"

The whiplash in Paris from healthy outlier to overnight hotspot illustrates the balancing act states are taking on as they begin relaxing public health restrictions. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)Barely a week ago, rural Lamar County could make a pretty good argument for Texas’ reopening on Friday. Only a handful of the 50,000 residents here, right on the border with Oklahoma, had tested positive for the coronavirus. None had died. The mayor of Paris, Texas — a pit stop for drivers passing through to snap a selfie with the city’s miniaturized Eiffel Tower — had drive-thru virus testing in the works, just to give locals peace of mind. Some wore masks but many saw little reason to bother.Then an outbreak at a nursing home turned up over the weekend.Now at least 65 people are infected, and everything has changed. A courier drove 11 hours through the night to pick up testing kits and stores are second-guessing reopening as Lamar County becomes a cautionary tale of the fragility of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s plan to get Texas back in business faster than many states. And on the eve of every retailer, restaurant and movie theater being allowed to let customers back in the door, Texas set a single-day record high for COVID-19 fatalities Thursday with 50.“We don’t know what it’s going to do here,” said Taylor Wright, owner of Aden Ann’s, a women’s boutique in Paris. Word of the sudden outbreak at Paris Healthcare Center, she said, shelved her plans to reopen over fears of exposing her staff and family.“We don’t know where it’s all spreading,” she said.The whiplash in Paris from healthy outlier to overnight hot spot illustrates the balancing act states are taking on as they begin relaxing public health restrictions, particularly in places with Republican governors, who broadly support President Donald Trump’s determination to get the U.S. economy back up and running.In Texas, Abbott’s instinct throughout the crisis has been to govern from the middle ground, reflected in his reluctance early on to issue statewide stay-at-home orders that soured conservative activists. Democrats who control Texas’ booming big cities, meanwhile, have praised him for shaking loose protective gear from a stretched-thin supply chain, but the speed at which Abbott is now hitting the reset button is making some fidget.Like many governors, Abbott is taking a piecemeal approach to rolling back restrictions. Counties with fewer than five active cases of COVID-19 can reopen businesses at 50% capacity, which Abbott on Monday said would apply to nearly half of Texas’ 254 counties. Everywhere else — which is where the vast majority of Texas’ nearly 30 million people live — can open back up at 25% capacity. Beaches in Texas are reopening this weekend, while hair salons, gyms and bars remain closed.Up until last weekend, Lamar County looked like a contender to begin to reopen under the loosest restrictions. There had been just eight cases of coronavirus as of April 23, and six of those people had recovered.“And then, ‘boom,’” Paris Mayor Steve Clifford said.The first positive case at the nursing home appeared the very next day. “It hits us, like, right between the eyes, and all of a sudden we have this really huge, huge outbreak.”Now Clifford, a radiologist, worries about a second wave. He worries about getting more testing kits, which has been a chronic problem that may have masked the true number of cases in his city from the start. He had purchased 1,500 antibody tests — a big gesture for a city of 25,000 — and did a trial run of drive-thru testing April 23, in preparation for opening up for three days this week.The nursing home outbreak scuttled those plans. One resident has died, but Clifford said if Texas doesn’t open back up soon, “every business in my city is going to go bankrupt and no one will have a job, and then there will be poverty.”Texas has reported 27,000 cases and more than 750 deaths linked to the virus, though the number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested. Studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick. Experts said a one-day spike in deaths is no cause for alarm on its own, since it could reflect a lag in reporting or patients who succumbed after battling the disease for weeks.But as Abbott targets May 18 as the date for peeling back restrictions even more, they also worry it’s rushed.“It seems a little bit jumping the gun. It seems a little fast, for sure,” said Dr. Diana Cervantes, an epidemiologist at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.It hasn’t come fast enough for John Bratcher, whose restaurant and beer garden, named 107, off the town square in Paris has been pushed to the breaking point. Money is tight despite having kept the kitchen open for to-go orders. He wishes the governor would let his outdoor patio, which sways Saturday nights with live music, accommodate at least a half-full crowd again.“He’s trying to take into consideration all areas of Texas,” Bratcher said. “And that’s a tough one.”"
39bed91749dd16f0c82aec102303ead2,"Taliban seize Jalalabad, cut off Afghan capital from east. The Taliban seized the city of Jalalabad early Sunday, cutting off Afghanistan’s increasingly isolated capital Kabul to the east as the insurgents’ blitz across the country continued as the U.S. and NATO prepare to withdraw from the country after two decades of war.The militants posted photos online early Sunday showing them in the governor’s office in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province.Abrarullah Murad, a lawmaker from the province told The Associated Press that the insurgents seized Jalalabad after elders negotiated the fall of the government there.The seizure Sunday comes amid rapid gains by the Taliban over the last week, pressuring Afghanistan’s central government as U.S., British and Canadian forces rush troops in to help their diplomatic staffs still there. Thousands have poured into Kabul to flee the Taliban advance.The fall Saturday of Mazar-e-Sharif, the country’s fourth largest city, which Afghan forces and two powerful former warlords had pledged to defend, hands the insurgents control over all of northern Afghanistan.On Saturday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani delivered a televised speech, his first public appearance since the recent Taliban gains. He vowed not to give up the “achievements” of the 20 years since the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks.The U.S. has continued holding peace talks between the government and the Taliban in Qatar this week, and the international community has warned that a Taliban government brought about by force would be shunned. But the insurgents appear to have little interest in making concessions as they rack up victories on the battlefield.“We have started consultations, inside the government with elders and political leaders, representatives of different levels of the community as well as our international allies,” Ghani said. “Soon the results will be shared with you,” he added, without elaborating further.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_2762879448 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_yhb3023l/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_yhb3023l_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Haqikat Kya Hai | Over 200 Taliban terrorists killed in airstrikes in Afghanistan"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""2416"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_2762879448 = ''; jwsetup_2762879448(); function jwsetup_2762879448() { jwvidplayer_2762879448 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_2762879448"").setup(jwconfig_2762879448); jwvidplayer_2762879448.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_2762879448, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_yhb3023l\"", ns_st_pr=\""Haqikat Kya Hai | Over 200 Taliban terrorists killed in airstrikes in Afghanistan\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Haqikat Kya Hai | Over 200 Taliban terrorists killed in airstrikes in Afghanistan\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Haqikat Kya Hai | Over 200 Taliban terrorists killed in airstrikes in Afghanistan\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-08-08\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-08-08\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_yhb3023l/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_2762879448.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_2762879448.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_2762879448.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_2762879448.stop(); jwvidplayer_2762879448.remove(); jwvidplayer_2762879448 = ''; jwsetup_2762879448(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_2762879448.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_2762879448.stop(); jwvidplayer_2762879448.remove(); jwvidplayer_2762879448 = ''; jwsetup_2762879448(); return; }); jwvidplayer_2762879448.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_2762879448.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_2762879448.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_2762879448.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_2762879448.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_2762879448.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

2864b44115b9d55d88c46e39a9d4448f,"In this Oct. 23, 2020, file photo, Salt Lake County Health Department public health nurses look on during coronavirus testing outside the Salt Lake County Health Department in Salt Lake City. Deaths per day from the coronavirus in the U.S. are on the rise again, just as health experts had feared, and cases are climbing in nearly every single state.Deaths per day from the coronavirus in the U.S. are on the rise again, just as health experts had feared, and cases are climbing in practically every state, despite assurances from President Donald Trump over the weekend that “we’re rounding the turn, we’re doing great.”With Election Day just over a week away, average deaths per day across the country are up 10% over the past two weeks, from 721 to nearly 794 as of Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Newly confirmed infections per day are rising in 47 states, and deaths are up in 34.Health experts had warned that it was only a matter of time before deaths turned upward, given the record-breaking surge in cases engulfing the country. Deaths are a lagging indicator — that is, it generally takes a few weeks for people to sicken and die from the coronavirus.Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases who warned over the summer of a fall surge, said what’s happening now is a confluence of three factors: “pandemic fatigue” among people who are weary of hunkering down and are venturing out more; “pandemic anger” among those are don’t believe the scourge is a real threat; and cold weather, which is forcing more Americans indoors, where the virus can spread more easily.“When you put those three together, we shouldn’t be surprised what we’re seeing,” Osterholm said.The virus is blamed for more than 8.6 million confirmed infections and over 225,000 deaths in the U.S., the highest such totals in the world.Deaths are still well below the U.S. peak of over 2,200 per day in late April. But experts are warning of a grim fall and winter, with a widely cited model from the University of Washington projecting about 386,000 dead by Feb. 1. A vaccine is unlikely to become widely available until mid-2021.The seven-day rolling average for daily new cases hit a record high on Sunday of 68,767, according to Johns Hopkins, eclipsing the previous mark of 67,293, set in mid-July. The U.S. recorded more than 80,000 new cases on both Friday and Saturday — the highest marks ever — though testing has expanded dramatically over the course of the outbreak, making direct comparisons problematic.The true number of infections is thought to be far higher because many Americans have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.On Wall Street, stocks had their worst day in more than a month, amid the surging caseload and mounting doubts that Washington will come through with more relief for the economy before Election Day. The S&P 500 slid 1.9% Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 650 points or 2.3%.On Monday, the White House coronavirus response coordinator spent the day looking around North Dakota’s capital city and proclaimed the COVID-19 protocols to be the worst she’s seen in her travels around the country.Dr. Deborah Birx, whose tour has taken her to nearly 40 states, said she found the absence of face coverings and the lack of social distancing in Bismarck “deeply unfortunate” and a danger.“Over the last 24 hours as we were here and we were in your grocery stores and in your restaurants and frankly even in your hotels, this is the least use of masks that we have we seen in retail establishments of any place we have been,” Birx said. “And we find that deeply unfortunate because you don’t know who’s infected and you don’t know if you’ve infected yourself.”In the Texas border city of El Paso, authorities instructed people to stay home for two weeks and imposed a 10-p.m.-to-5-a.m. curfew because of a surge that has overwhelmed hospitals. The state is converting part of the city’s civic centre into a hospital.“We are in a crisis stage,” El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, the county’s top elected official, as he issued the stay-at-home order over the weekend.On Monday, the county reported a record high in daily cases, with 1,443, and 853 patients hospitalized because of the virus, up from 786 a day earlier. The state has provided over 900 medical personnel to El Paso, some of whom will staff the convention center site.Just last week, Trump during the last presidential debate downplayed the virus’ effect in the Lone Star State, saying: “There was a very big spike in Texas, it’s now gone.”Trump said repeatedly over the weekend that the country is “rounding the turn.” His remarks came amid another outbreak in the White House inner circle. Several close aides to Vice President Mike Pence tested positive, including his chief of staff.In Idaho, where large numbers of residents resist wearing a mask, Republican Gov. Brad Little on Monday ordered a return to some restrictions to slow the spread of the virus as rising cases put a strain on the hospital system.Little’s directive limits indoor gatherings to 50 people, urges businesses to encourage employees to work from home, among other steps.Idaho’s positivity test rate is fourth-worst in the nation. St. Luke’s, with hospitals in southwestern and central Idaho, is reporting that 20% of hospitalized patients are suffering from COVID-19. Its hospital in Twin Falls has postponed elective surgeries and are sending children in need of medical care to Boise, about 125 miles away.Primary Health Medical Group, the largest independent medical group in Idaho, has had to close two of its 19 urgent care clinics in southwestern Idaho because of sick or quarantined staff. The clinics are a buffer keeping hospital emergency rooms in the region from getting clogged with patients not needing emergency-level care.Oklahoma is one of the states consistently breaking records for new cases, and the strain is being felt in hospitals. Bed space is running out, and an equally daunting problem is a shortage of nursing staff.Dr. Sam Ratermann, director of the hospitalist program at INTEGRIS Grove Hospital in Grove, Oklahoma, said patients are being transferred from “hospital to hospital across the state” for lack of beds.“Even when we have open ICU beds across the state, we don’t have staff to fill them,” Ratermann said. “There’s going to be a point where there’s no beds and we can’t even care for our local citizens.”The University of Minnesota’s Osterholm has been predicting the darkest days will be in the weeks or months ahead. He said he expects increased competition for drugs and shortages of hospital specialists, N95 masks and other protective gear.A strong national response plan was needed, along with consistent messaging that emphasized mask-wearing and other preventive measures, Osterholm said.“But our response has been... I don’t know what our response has been,” he said.(Except for the headline, Indiatvnews.com has not edited anything in the copy)"

a989372258b309ca72391aef16bf33b8,"President-elect Joe Biden speaks about jobs at The Queen theaterCalifornia certified its presidential election Friday and appointed 55 electors pledged to vote for Democrat Joe Biden, officially handing him the Electoral College majority needed to win the White House.Secretary of State Alex Padilla’s formal approval of Biden’s win in the state brought his tally of pledged electors so far to 279, according to a tally by The Associated Press. That’s just over the 270 threshold for victory.These steps in the election are often ignored formalities. But the hidden mechanics of electing a U.S. president have drawn new scrutiny this year as President Donald Trump continues to deny Biden’s victory and pursues increasingly specious legal strategies aimed at overturning the results before they are finalized.Although it’s been apparent for weeks that Biden won the presidential election, his accrual of more than 270 electors is the first step toward the White House, said Edward B. Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University.“It is a legal milestone and the first milestone that has that status,” Foley said. “Everything prior to that was premised on what we call projections.”The electors named Friday will meet Dec. 14, along with counterparts in each state, to formally vote for the next president. Most states have laws binding their electors to the winner of the popular vote in their state, measures that were upheld by a Supreme Court decision this year. There have been no suggestions that any of Biden’s pledged electors would contemplate not voting for him.Results of the Electoral College vote are due to be received, and typically approved, by Congress on Jan. 6. Although lawmakers can object to accepting the electors’ votes, it would be almost impossible for Biden to be blocked at that point.The Democratic-controlled House and Republican-controlled Senate would both vote separately to resolve any disputes. One already has arisen from Pennsylvania, where 75 Republican lawmakers signed a statement on Friday urging Congress to block the state’s electoral votes from being cast for Biden. But the state’s Republican U.S. senator, Pat Toomey, said soon afterward that he would not be objecting to Pennsylvania’s slate of electors, underscoring the difficulty in trying to change the election results through Congress.“As a practical matter, we know that Joe Biden is going to be inaugurated on Jan. 20,” Foley said.That was clear in the days after the election, when the count of mail ballots gradually made clear that Biden had won victories in enough states to win the Electoral College. It became even more apparent in late November, when every swing state won by Biden certified him as the winner of its elections and appointed his electors to the Electoral College. Trump has fruitlessly tried to stop those states from certifying Biden as the winner and appointing electors for the former vice president.He made no effort in deeply Democratic California, the most populous state in the nation and the trove of its largest number of electoral votes. Three more states won by Biden — Colorado, Hawaii and New Jersey — have not yet certified their results. When they do, Biden will have 306 Electoral College votes to Trump’s 232.Trump and his allies have brought at least 50 legal cases trying to overturn the results in the swing states Biden won — mainly Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. More than 30 have been rejected or dropped, according to an AP tally.Trump and his allies have also raised the far-fetched notion that Republican state legislatures in those states could appoint a rival set of electors pledged to Trump.But state Republican leaders have rejected that approach, and it would likely be futile in any case. According to federal law, both chambers of Congress would need to vote to accept a competing slate of electors. If they don’t, the electors appointed by the states’ governors — all pledged to Biden in these cases — must be used.The last remaining move to block the election would be the quixotic effort to vote down the electors in Congress.This tactic has been tried — a handful of congressional Democrats in 2000, 2004 and 2016 objected to officially making both George W. Bush and Trump president. But the numbers were not enough to block the two men from taking office.ALSO READ | COVID-19 vaccine in US will not be mandatory: Joe Biden"
6983df46343e7025bf6a2f98ba3da1c7,"British Indian minister Alok Sharma given sole charge of UN climate summitAlok Sharma, one of the Indian-origin ministers in UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Cabinet, has relinquished his role as Business Secretary in a mini-reshuffle to take sole charge as President of COP26 – the United Nations climate summit scheduled for Glasgow, Scotland, in November.The Agra-born minister, who was until now in charge of dual roles, will focus entirely on what has been dubbed as the largest summit the UK has ever hosted, bringing together representatives from nearly 200 countries, including India.Downing Street said on Friday that Johnson had asked Sharma to take on the new charge to drive forward coordinated global action to tackle climate change to meet the high ambitions for the summit.“The biggest challenge of our time is climate change and we need to work together to deliver a cleaner, greener world and build back better for present and future generations,” said Sharma.“Through the UK’s Presidency of COP26 we have a unique opportunity, working with friends and partners around the world, to deliver on this goal.Given the vital importance of tackling climate change I am delighted to have been asked by the Prime Minister to dedicate all my energies to this urgent task,” he said.The COP26 President will be based in the UK Cabinet Office, continuing as a full member of Cabinet, and will chair the Climate Action Implementation Committee to coordinate government action towards net zero by 2050 in the run up to the November summit.“A successful summit in November will be critical if we want to meet the objectives set out by the Paris Agreement and reduce global emissions. The UK has set a high bar, with our recent commitment to reduce emissions by at least 68 per cent by 2030, but we also need other countries to do their bit,” Downing Street said.Sharma has been described as a “leading force” behind the UK’s climate diplomacy, since assuming the role in February 2020. The Climate Ambition Summit co-hosted by the UK in December last year saw 75 world leaders set out new commitments to climate action.Kwasi Kwarteng, who was a minister of state in the Business department, has been promoted to take over from Sharma as Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.Anne-Marie Trevelyan will step into Kwarteng's place as Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth. She will also continue in her role as the UK’s International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP26 Presidency, supporting countries vulnerable to climate change to adapt to its impacts and build resilience.Downing Street said the changes are part of the government’s Ten Point Plan on going further and faster towards a greener future, including committing to end the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030, supporting renewable energy projects across the UK, investing in technology and transforming the energy efficiency of the UK’s homes and public buildings. ALSO READ | Bihar CM Nitish Kumar shares state's sustainable development efforts at UN climate roundtable"

aa94fe78ec0b1e9641f9e6507c47e93b,"Oxford scientists to study ivermectin's efficacy for COVID treatment. A team of scientists at the University of Oxford have on Wednesday announced a trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of ivermectin- an antiparasitic drug- for people at more risk of serious illness from Covid-19.Previous studies of ivermectin, which show that early administration with ivermectin can reduce viral load and the duration of symptoms in some patients with mild Covid, have generally been small or low quality.The World Health Organisation in March and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had, in April last year, recommended against the use of ivermectin in treating Covid patients. The WHO said there was a ""very low certainty of evidence"" on ivermectin's effects on mortality, hospital admission and getting rid of the virus from the body.""Safety and efficacy are important when using any drug for a new indication. @WHO recommends against the use of ivermectin for #COVID19 except within clinical trials,"" Soumya Swaminathan, the global health body's chief scientist, said in a tweet.However, ivermectin has been taken up by doctors and by individuals self-medicating in countries, including Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and South Africa.""Ivermectin is readily available globally, has been in wide use for many other infectious conditions so it's a well-known medicine with a good safety profile, and because of the early promising results in some studies it is already being widely used to treat Covid-19 in several countries,"" said Professor Chris Butler, from the University Oxford's Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, said in a statement.""By including ivermectin in a large-scale trial, we hope to generate robust evidence to determine how effective the treatment is against Covid-19, and whether there are benefits or harms associated with its use,"" he added.The trial has so far recruited more than 5,000 volunteers from across the UK, who will be randomly assigned to receive a three-day course of ivermectin treatment. They will be followed-up for 28 days and will be compared with participants who have been assigned to receive the usual standard of National Health Service care only.People aged 18 to 64 with certain underlying health conditions or shortness of breath from Covid-19, or aged over 65, are eligible to join the trial within the first 14 days of experiencing Covid-19 symptoms or receiving a positive test.People with severe liver disease, who are on the blood-thinning medication warfarin, or taking other treatments known to interact with ivermectin, will be excluded.The trial can be joined easily from anywhere in the UK either online, over the telephone or via a GP practice, and without the need for face-to-face visits with the trial team in Oxford.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

I have no hesitation in saying that in the way of SAARC's progress and in the way of the region's connectivity and prosperity, there is only one obstruction and one attitude. The attitude of one nation is making the spirit of SAARC and the spirit of the founding fathers of SAARC unfulfilled,"" he said, without naming India.Asked if he had talks with Swaraj at the meeting, Qureshi denied. ""She left the meeting mid-way, may be she was not feeling well,"" he said.He said Swaraj talked about regional cooperation, but ""my question is how will regional cooperation be possible when the regional nations are ready to sit together and you are the obstruction in that dialogue and discussion.""Qureshi said a majority of the members present in the meeting understands the significance of SAARC. ""They want to move on. I cant speak for them but I can deduce from their body language, disappointment; because if you do not move on and if you do not sit and convene meetings how do you move on,"" he said.He cited other regional groupings such as ASEAN and the EU and said ""look at this (SAARC) atmosphere""He called Swaraj's statement at the meeting ""very vague"".He said ""you said the next summit will not happen until there is conducive environment. How do you define what conducive environment is? It can vary from country to country.""Qureshi's remarks came days after New Delhi cancelled a proposed meeting between foreign ministers of India and Pakistan in New York. India cited attacks by Islamabad-backed groups in Jammu and Kashmir and stamps released by Pakistan glorifying Kashmiri terrorists as reasons for cancellation of the proposed talks.SAARC member-states have previously said they view the strained relations between India and Pakistan as one of the reasons for the little progress achieved by the geopolitical grouping in recent years.Nepal And Sri Lanka have expressed interest in reviving the summit postponed in 2016 after New Delhi pulled out over Islamabad's unrelenting support to terrorist activities in India and after Pakistan-based terrorists attack an Indian Army base in Uri.Bhutan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan had also joined India in boycotting the summit.The SAARC grouping includes India, Pakistan and six other regional countries. It was established in December 1985 with an aim to promote the welfare of the peoples of South Asia.SAARC summits are usually held biennially. The member-state hosting the summit assumes the Chair of the association. The last SAARC Summit in 2014 was held in Kathmandu, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. WATCH VIDEO:"

1572d02e2049baec2ba5fbca887142e2,"No announcement on withdrawal of troops from Germany: White HousePresident Donald Trump is constantly reassessing the best posture for the American military forces and its presence overseas, the White House has said, while clarifying that there is no announcement to make on the withdrawal of US troops in Germany.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany made the comments at a press conference on Monday while responding to media reports that Trump has decided to withdraw thousands of US troops from Germany, a NATO ally. “We have no announcements at this time. I know there's reporting out there, but, as of this moment, there are no announcements.“The President is continually reassessing the best posture for the United States Military forces and our presence overseas. I mean, we remain committed to working with our strong allies,” McEnany said. Currently there are about 34,500 US troops stationed in Germany. According to The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, the reported troop reduction plan of Trump would cap US soldiers in Germany to 25,000.A senior US official said the administration has been discussing the move since September and that it is not linked to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision not to attend a G-7 meeting Trump was to host in Washington in the end of June, according to The Wall Street Journal. Officials on Friday said that the Trump administration ordered the change in a memorandum signed recently by White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien.The Washington Post had reported that Germany was not informed about the decision as of Friday. The reduction plan, it said, was pushed by US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, who has also served for the past several months as acting director of national intelligence. Congressman Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, described the decision as reckless.""Vladimir Putin (Russian president) must be delighted that the American president is gutting our own deterrent against Russian aggression in Europe,"" he said in a statement. ""And the president's (Trump) insulting dismissal of one of our most important relationships because of a personal vendetta confirms that he lacks moral leadership, respect for our allies and understanding of our national security interests,” Engel said.Meanwhile, AP reported from Berlin on Saturday that German lawmaker Norbert Roettgen has criticised the reported US troops withdrawal plan, terming it as ""very regrettable.""In an interview published Saturday by Germany's Funke Media Group, lawmaker Roettgen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Union bloc who chairs the German parliament's foreign policy committee, was quoted as saying that he couldn't see “any factual reason for the withdrawal"" and that US soldiers were welcome in Germany. "
c92b64352249620e3130284b101b6ad2,"Donald Trump/File ImageUS President Donald Trump said Thursday all American sanctions against Iran will be in full force on November 5, as he signed into law another legislation imposing hard-hitting sanctions on Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.""On November 5th, all US sanctions against Iran lifted by the nuclear deal will be back in full force, every sanction that we had on their originally, which would have -- if they would have just left it a little bit longer, would have been so much easier than what we've been through over the last number of years,"" Trump said at a White House event.After withdrawing from the Iranian nuclear deal, Trump has asked all countries to reduce their purchase of oil from Iran to zero or face secondary sanctions. India, being one of the largest importers of Iranian oil, also comes under the purview of American sanctions. To avoid this, India either needs a waiver from the US or has to bring down the purchase of Iranian oil to zero.Trump said these sanctions will be followed up with even more sanctions to address the full range of Iran's ""malign conduct"".""We will not allow the world's leading sponsor of terror to develop the world's deadliest weapons. Will not happen,"" he said.Moments earlier, Trump signed into law the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act (HIFPAA) of 2018, which imposes additional hard-hitting sanctions on Hezbollah.""Hezbollah has kidnapped, tortured, and murdered American citizens, including in its brutal attack in 1983 on our Marine Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed 241 American Marines, Sailors, and Soldiers, wounded 128 other American service members, and killed a Lebanese civilian.""Another bombing against the French barracks killed 58 French peacekeepers and five Lebanese civilians, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.The legislation, Sanders said, will further isolate Hezbollah from the international financial system and reduce its funding.These sanctions will target foreign persons and government agencies that knowingly assist or support Hezbollah, and Hezbollah-affiliated networks that engage in drug trafficking or other transnational crime, she said.During a White House event Thursday night to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the attack in Beirut on the Marine Barracks with survivors and family members of the victims, Trump said over the past year, his administration has levied the highest number of sanctions ever imposed on Hezbollah in a single year, by far.""Just a few moments ago I signed legislation imposing even more hard-hitting sanctions on Hezbollah to further starve them of them of their funds. And they are starving of funds,"" he said.""We will target, disrupt, and dismantle their operational and financing networks of which they had plenty. They don't have plenty now. And we will never forget what they did to our great Marines in Beirut. We will never forget,"" the US president said."

Again, I'm not going to characterize what they are thinking. I'm certainly not going to characterize how they may or may not use this information to make decisions. That's not my place. But I do think that making this information public contributes to an understanding that this has been a strategic failure for Russia. Obviously, we will continue to pursue our strategy of imposing severe costs on Russia, and trying to strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,"" Bedingfield said.She reiterated that President Joe Biden has not been advocating for a policy of regime change. ""What he said a couple of days ago was a statement of personal moral outrage, but we do not have a formal policy of regime change. What we are doing is continuing to impose unprecedented costs on Russia,"" she said.""We are ensuring that Russia is paying for this choice. Putin himself has said that the cost, the impact of the sanctions, has been significant. So, we are continuing to focus on our strategy of making sure that we are providing security assistance to Ukraine and imposing significant costs on Russia for these choices,"" she noted.READ MORE: Russia shells areas in Ukraine where it vowed to scale back, including capital Kyiv"

""When will full internet access be restored (not just access at kiosks)?"" it asked.""How many people have been detained under the Public Safety Act or other legal provisions since August 5th?

aef28f495bccbfa95b508fde335981a8,"In a move that has left officials in Islamabad ""stunned"", China has stop funding at least three major road projects in Pakistan, being built as part of the $62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, following reports of corruption, a media report said on Tuesday.The decision by the Chinese government is likely to hit over Rs 1 trillion-worth road projects of the Pakistan's National Highway Authority (NHA), and initially, may delay at least three such ventures, Dawn newspaper reported.According to a senior government official, the funds would be released after Beijing issues 'new guidelines'.The nearly $62 billion CPEC, a flagship project of China's prestigious One Belt One Road, passes through Pakistan -occupied Kashmir (PoK). It links China's restive Xinjiang region with Pakistan's Balochistan province.The road projects that are likely to be affected include 210-km-long Dera Ismail Khan-Zhob Road, being built at an estimated cost of Rs 81 billion. Of this, Rs 66 billion would be spent on construction of road while Rs 15 billion on land acquisition.The other project which is going to be hit is 110-km-long Khuzdar-Basima Road, having an estimated cost of Rs 19.76 billion.The third project is Rs 8.5 billion worth, the remaining 136-km of Karakarom Highway (KKH) from Raikot to Thakot.Originally, all the three projects were part of the Pakistan government's own development programme, but in December 2016, the NHA spokesperson had announced that they would be included under the CPEC umbrella so as to become eligible for concessionary finance from China.""The funds for the three road projects were approved in the 6th Joint Cooperation Committee meeting held last year, pending necessary procedural formalities.""It was expected that the funding of the three projects would be finalised during the Joint Working Group (JWG) meeting held on November 20, but Pakistan was informed in the meeting that 'new guidelines' will be issued from Beijing under which new modus operandi for release of the funds will be described,"" the official was quoted as saying by the newspaper.The decision of the Chinese government was conveyed to Pakistan in the JWG meeting and the existing procedure for release of funds had been abolished, he said.Under the previous procedure, the projects were to be approved by six different forums after which the funds were released, the official added.""In fact, the Chinese authorities informed us that the previous procedure of release of funds was meant for early harvest projects only and new guidelines will be issued for future projects of the CPEC,"" the official said.The official said the Pakistani side was left ""stunned"" when informed about this development, as it was the first time they were hearing it.He, however, claimed that Chinese side was quite disturbed with media reports, published in Pakistan, about corruption in the CPEC projects and and that was the reason Beijing has temporarily halted release of funds for the corridor.CPEC was launched in 2015 when President Xi Jinping visited Pakistan and it now envisages investment of around $62 billion in different projects of development in Pakistan.(With PTI inputs)"
cc7ee4e181dc8651df2b691b7df2e4fd,"Welcoming the appointment of a special counsel to probe his presidential campaign’s alleged involvement with Russia, US President Donald Trump on Thursday termed the whole issue as a “witch hunt” against him.“There is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign,” he said while responding to a question on the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Muller to investigate the allegations of Russian interference in the elections.“Well, I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt,” Trump told reporters at a White House news conference with Colombia President Juan Manuel Santos yesterday.The president has maintained that he has nothing to do with Russia.“I can always speak for myself and the Russians—zero.  I think it divides the country. I think we have a very divided country because of that and many other things,” he said.  The US president said he wants to bring America and has had tremendous success in doing so.“You look at our job numbers. You look at what’s going on at the border, as we discussed before. You look at what will be happening. You’re going to see some incredible numbers with respect to the success of (defence secretary) general (James) Mattis and others with the ISIS situation. The numbers are staggering, how successful the military has been,” Trump said.  His remarks came ahead of his maiden foreign trip starting with a visit to Saudi Arabia.“Tomorrow, I’m going to Saudi Arabia. I’m going to Israel. I’m going to Rome. And we have the G7. We have a lot of great things going on. So I hate to see anything that divides. I’m fine with whatever people want to do. But we have to get back to running this country really, really well. We’ve made tremendous progress in the last 100 and some odd days,” Trump said.He reiterated that there was no collusion between his campaign and the Russians.“Believe me, there’s no collusion. Russia is fine. But whether it’s Russia or anybody else, my total priority, believe me, is the United States of America,” he said.  Responding to question about the call for his impeachment as raised by the Democrats, Trump said it is ridiculous and maintained that the US is progressing under his rule.  “I think it’s totally ridiculous. Everybody thinks so.  “We have to get back to working our country properly so that we can take care of the problems that we have. We have plenty of problems. We’ve done a fantastic job,” he said.  Talking about the appointment of a new FBI chief for which he has been interviewing several candidates in the past few days, Trump said he will be announcing the new director soon and looks forward to doing it.“I think the people in the FBI will be very, very, very, very thrilled,” he said.He said that he looks forward to getting the whole controversy behind him so that he can focus on creating jobs and making a strong military.“We need health care. We need to cut taxes. We’re going to cut taxes. If I get what I want, it’ll be the biggest tax cut in the history of our nation. And that’s what I want. It’s going to bring back companies. It’s going to bring back jobs.  We lost so many jobs and so many companies,” Trump said.  “We want to get back and keep on the track that we’re on, because the track that we’re on is record-setting. And that’s what we want to do is we want to break very positive records,” he said.(With PTI inputs)"

0d0930fed7134c9a2931451e9920bf71,"Members of the gorilla troop at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in Escondido, Calif., are seen in their habitat on Sunday, Jan. 10, 2021. Several gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park have tested positive for the coronavirus in what is believed to be the first known cases among such primates in the United States and possibly the world.The park’s executive director, Lisa Peterson, told The Associated Press on Monday that eight gorillas that live together at the park are believed to have the virus and several have been coughing.It appears the infection came from a member of the park’s wildlife care team who also tested positive for the virus but has been asymptomatic and wore a mask at all times around the gorillas. The park has been closed to the public since Dec. 6 as part of the state of California’s lockdown efforts to curb coronavirus cases.Veterinarians are closely monitoring the gorillas and they will remain in their habitat at the park, north of San Diego, Peterson said. For now, they are being given vitamins, fluid and food but no specific treatment for the virus.“Aside from some congestion and coughing, the gorillas are doing well,” Peterson said.While other wildlife has contracted the coronavirus from minks to tigers, this is the first known instance of transmission to great apes and it is unknown if they will have any serious reaction.Wildlife experts have expressed concern about the coronavirus infecting gorillas, an endangered species that share 98.4 percent of their DNA with humans and are inherently social animals.The gorillas infected at the San Diego safari park are western lowland gorillas, whose population has declined by more than 60% over the last two decades because of poaching and disease, according to the World Wildlife Fund.The safari park tested feces of the troop of gorillas after two apes began coughing on Jan. 6. Positive test results were confirmed by the U.S Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services Laboratories in three gorillas. Feces from all eight in the troop are being taken for testing.Zoo officials are talking to experts who have been treating the coronavirus in humans in case the animals develop more severe symptoms. They will remain together since separating them could be harmful to the gorillas that live in tight-knit groups.“This is wildlife, and they have their own resiliency and can heal differently than we do,” Peterson said.The safari park on Monday added more safety measures for its staff, including requiring face shields and eye goggles when working in contact with the animals.The confirmation that gorillas are susceptible to the coronavirus contributes to information about how the pandemic may affect these species in their native habitats where they come into contact with humans and human materials, the park officials said.San Diego Zoo Safari Park plans to share what it learns with health officials, conservationists and scientists to develop steps to protect gorillas in the forests of Africa."

b90d7facd20d4246680e0e8825fe82ff,"North Korea's missile launch is displayed at the Unification Observation Post in Paju, near the border with North Korea, South KoreaSouth Korea said North Korea fired two unidentified projectiles into its eastern waters on Thursday as it revives its testing activity to expand its military capabilities and pressure the Biden administration while nuclear negotiations remain stalled.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the U.S. and South Korean militaries were analyzing the launches that were conducted from an area on the North’s eastern coast. It didn’t immediately say whether the weapons were ballistic or how far they flew.But Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the North Korean weapons were ballistic missiles and that they did not reach Japanese waters. Suga said the launches threaten “peace and safety in Japan and the region,” and that Tokyo will closely coordinate with Washington and Seoul on the North’s testing activities.The launches came a day after U.S. and South Korean officials said the North fired short-range weapons presumed to be cruise missiles into its western sea over the weekend.The negotiations over the North’s nuclear program faltered after the collapse of Kim Jong Un’s second summit with former President Donald Trump in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of their nuclear capabilities.Since Trump’s first meeting with Kim in 2018, the North has not conducted nuclear or long-range missile tests, although analysts believe they have pressed ahead with their programs on both.The North has continued short- and medium range missile testing during its suspension of nuclear and long-range tests, expanding its ability to strike targets in South Korea and Japan, including U.S. bases there.North Korea has so far ignored the Biden administration’s efforts to reach out, saying it won’t engage in meaningful talks unless Washington abandons its “hostile” policies.Kim’s powerful sister last week berated the United States over its latest round of combined military exercises with South Korea that ended earlier this month, describing the drills as an invasion rehearsal and warned Washington to “refrain from causing a stink” if it wants to “sleep in peace” for the next four years.Just hours after Thursday’s launches, South Korea Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong was to meet with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Seoul for discussions on North Korea and other regional issues. South Korea’s presidential office said it will hold an emergency National Security Council meeting to discuss the launches.South Korea’s Defense Ministry said the North’s short-range tests on Sunday were its first missile firings since April 2020. President Joe Biden played down those launches, telling reporters, “There’s no new wrinkle in what they did.”North Korea has a history of testing new U.S. administrations with missile launches and other provocations aimed at forcing the Americans back to the negotiating table.While Kim has vowed to strengthen his nuclear weapons program in recent speeches, he also tried to give the new U.S. administration an opening by saying that the fate of their relations depends on Washington.During his visit to Seoul last week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sternly criticized North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and human rights record and pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince the North to denuclearize.ALSO READ | North Korea conducts short-range missile test, says White House"

The ban had relegated women to the backseat, restricting when and how they move around.Related Stories Saudi woman gets 200 lashes, 6 months jail for being raped by seven menFor the first time, Saudi Arabia to allow women to driveBut after midnight Sunday, Saudi women finally joined women around the world in being able to get behind the wheel of a car and simply drive.“I’m speechless. I’m so excited it’s actually happening,” said Hessah al-Ajaji, who drove her family’s Lexus down the capital’s busy Tahlia Street after midnight.Al-Ajaji had a U.S. driver’s license before obtaining a Saudi one and appeared comfortable at the wheel as she pulled up and parked. As for the male drivers on the road, “they were really supportive and cheering and smiling,” she said.In a few hours, she says she’ll drive herself to work for the first time in Saudi Arabia.For nearly three decades, outspoken Saudi women and the men who supported them had called for women to have the right to drive. They faced arrest for defying the ban as women in other Muslim countries drove freely.In 1990, during the first driving campaign by activists, women who got behind the wheels of their cars in the capital, Riyadh, lost their jobs, faced severe stigmatization and were barred from travel abroad for a year.Ultraconservatives in Saudi Arabia had long warned that allowing women to drive would lead to sin and expose women to harassment. Ahead of allowing women to drive, the kingdom passed a law against sexual harassment with up to five years prison for the most severe cases.Criticism against women driving has largely been muted since since King Salman announced last year that they would be allowed to drive.Simultaneously, however, at least 10 of the most outspoken supporters of women’s rights were arrested just weeks before the ban was lifted, signaling that only the king and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, will decide the pace of change.With state-backed support for the move, many Saudis now say they support the decision allowing women to drive and see it as long overdue.Not all women are driving at once, though. The overwhelming majority of women in Saudi Arabia still don’t have licenses. Many haven’t had a chance to take the gender-segregated driving courses that were first offered to women only three months ago. There’s also a waiting list of several months for the classes on offer in major cities. And the classes can be costly, running several hundred dollars.Other women already own cars driven by chauffeurs and are in no rush to drive themselves. In many cases, women say they’ll wait before rushing to drive to see how the situation on the streets pans out and how male drivers react.“I will get my driver’s license, but I won’t drive because I have a driver. I am going to leave it for an emergency. It is one of my rights and I will keep it in my purse,” said 60 year-old Lulwa al-Fireiji.While some still quietly oppose the change, there are men openly embracing it.“I see that this decision will make women equal to men and this will show us that women are capable of doing anything a man can do,” said Fawaz al-Harbi. “I am very supportive and in fact I have been waiting for this decision so that my mother, my sisters will drive.”"

The city has seen at least 1,500 virus deaths.“It’s surreal,” owner Pat Marmo said, adding that he’s been begging families to insist hospitals hold their dead loved ones as long as possible. “We need help.”Worldwide the number of reported infections hit another gloomy milestone — 1 million, with more than 53,000 deaths, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. But the true numbers are believed to be much higher because of testing shortages, many mild cases that have gone unreported and suspicions that some countries are covering up the extent of their outbreaks.Spain on Thursday reported a record one-day number of deaths, 950, bringing its overall toll to about 10,000, despite signs that the infection rate is slowing. Italy recorded 760 more deaths, for a total of 13,900, the worst of any country, but new infections continued to level off.France recorded a running total of about 4,500 deaths in hospitals, with 471 in the past day. But officials expect the overall toll to jump significantly because they are only now starting to count deaths in nursing homes and other facilities for older people.A general view of a temporary field hospital set at Ifema convention and exhibition of in Madrid, Spain, Thursday, April 2, 2020. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.A general view of a temporary field hospital set at Ifema convention and exhibition of in Madrid, Spain, Thursday, April 2, 2020. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.France’s Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said he and his government colleagues are “fighting hour by hour” to ward off shortages of essential drugs used to keep COVID-19 patients alive in intensive care.As the death toll grew, so did the economic fallout. New unemployment numbers showed the outbreak has thrown 10 million Americans out of work in just two weeks in the swiftest, most stunning collapse the U.S. job market has ever witnessed.Roughly 90% of the U.S. population is under stay-at-home orders, and many factories, restaurants, stores and other businesses are closed or have seen sales shrivel. Economists warned unemployment would almost certainly top those of the Great Recession a decade ago and could reach levels not seen since the Great Depression in the 1930s.“My anxiety is through the roof right now, not knowing what’s going to happen,” said Laura Wieder, laid off from her job managing a now-closed sports bar in Bellefontaine, Ohio.The pandemic will cost the world economy as much as $4.1 trillion, or nearly 5% of all economic activity, the Philippines-based Asian Development Bank, said Friday.At least a million people in Europe are estimated to have lost their jobs over the past couple of weeks. Spain alone added more than 300,000 to its unemployment rolls in March.But the job losses in Europe appear to be far smaller than in the U.S. because of countries’ greater social safety nets.Estimates of those in China, the world’s second-largest economy, who have lost jobs or are underemployed run as high as 200 million. The government said Friday it would would provide an additional 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) to local banks to lend at preferential rates to small- and medium-sized businesses that provide the bulk of employment.With more than 245,000 people infected in the U.S. and the death toll topping 6,000, sobering preparations were underway. The Federal Emergency Management Agency asked the Pentagon for 100,000 body bags because of the possibility funeral homes will be overwhelmed, the military said.White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said U.S. infection data suggest Americans need to emulate those European nations that have started to see the spread of the virus slowing through strict social distancing.The Trump administration was formalizing new guidance to recommend Americans wear coverings such as non-medical masks, T-shirts or bandannas over their mouths and noses when out in public and preserve medical masks for those on the front lines.But there are still shortages of critical equipment, including masks, in Europe and the U.S.Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned that New York could run out of breathing machines in six days. He complained that states are competing against each other for protective gear and breathing machines, or are being outbid by the federal government.Trump invoked the Defense Production Act in hopes of boosting production of medical-grade masks by Minnesota-based 3M to assist first responders. Washington is also trying to crack down on a growing black market for protective medical supplies.Nine leading European university hospitals warned they will run out of essential medicines for COVID-19 patients in intensive care in less than two weeks.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with health problems, it can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia.In a sign of the outbreak’s impact on the U.S. military, the captain of a Navy aircraft carrier facing a growing outbreak of the virus was fired by Navy leaders who said he created a panic by sending his memo pleading for help to too many people. Navy Secretary Thomas Modly says the ship’s commander, Navy Capt. Brett Crozier, “demonstrated extremely poor judgment” in the middle of a crisis.Elsewhere among the world’s most vulnerable, aid workers were bracing for a possible outbreak among more than 1 million Rohingya Muslim refugees living in cramped camps in Bangladesh.And in a move likely to anger China, officials from the U.S. and Taiwan, the island claimed by Beijing as its own territory, held a virtual meeting Sunday to discuss ways of increasing Taiwan’s international participation, particularly in the World Health Organization from which it is excluded at China’s insistence."

General Assembly approved a resolution Friday strongly condemning human rights abuses against Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, including arbitrary arrests, torture, rape and deaths in detention. The 193-member world body voted 134-9 with 28 abstentions in favor of the resolution which also calls on Myanmar’s government to take urgent measures to combat incitement of hatred against the Rohingya and other minorities in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan states.General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding but they do reflect world opinion.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long considered the Rohingya to be “Bengalis” from Bangladesh even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless, and they are also denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.The long-simmering Rohingya crisis exploded on Aug. 25, 2017, when Myanmar’s military launched what it called a clearance campaign in Rakhine in response to an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group. The campaign led to the mass Rohingya exodus to Bangladesh and to accusations that security forces committed mass rapes and killings and burned thousands of homes.Myanmar’s U.N. ambassador, Hau Do Suan called the resolution “another classic example of double-standards (and) selective and discriminatory application of human rights norms”″ designed “to exert unwanted political pressure on Myanmar.””He said the resolution did not attempt to find a solution to the complex situation in Rakhine state and refused to recognize government efforts to address the challenges.The resolution, the ambassador said, “will sow seeds of distrust and will create further polarization of different communities in the region.”″The resolution expresses alarm at the continuing influx of Rohingya Muslims to neighboring Bangladesh over the last four decades, now numbering 1.1 million including 744,000 who arrived since August 2017, “ïn the aftermath of atrocities committed by the security and armed forces of Myanmar.”The assembly also expressed alarm at an independent international fact-finding mission’s findings “of gross human rights violations and abuses suffered by Rohingya Muslims and other minorities” by the security forces, which the mission said “undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law.”The resolution called for an immediate cessation of fighting and hostilities.It reiterated “deep distress at reports that unarmed individuals in Rakhine state have been and continue to be subjected to the excessive use of forces and violations of international human rights law, international humanitarian law by the military and security and armed forces.”And it called for Myanmar’s forces to protect all people, and for urgent steps to ensure justice for all rights violationsThe resolution also urged the government “to expedite efforts to eliminate statelessness and the systematic and institutionalized discrimination” against the Rohingya and other minorities, to dismantle camps for Rohingyas and others displaced in Rakhine, and “to create the conditions necessary for the safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return of all refugees, including Rohingya Muslim refugees.”It noted that the Rohingya have twice refused to return to Myanmar from Bangladesh because of the absence of these conditions.ALSO READ | Myanmar's Suu Kyi to face genocide allegations in courtALSO READ | Rohingya await justice as UN court begins hearing genocide allegations"

b43cf147cc41632bc3a376eef8302f3c,"4 dead in Waffle House shooting in Tennessee; suspect soughtA nearly naked gunman wearing only a green jacket and brandishing an assault rifle stormed a Waffle House restaurant in Nashville early Sunday, shooting four people to death before a customer rushed him and wrestled the weapon away.Authorities were searching for the 29-year-old suspect, Travis Reinking, who they said drove to the busy restaurant and killed two people in the parking lot before entering and continuing to fire. When his AR-15 rifle either jammed or the clip was empty, the customer disarmed him in a scuffle.Four people were also wounded before the gunman fled, throwing off his jacket.Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson said there was no clear motive, though Reinking may have “mental issues.” He may still be armed, Anderson told a mid-afternoon news conference, because he was known to have owned a handgun that authorities have not recovered.U.S. Secret Service agents arrested Reinking last July for being in a restricted area near the White House, officials said. Special Agent Todd Hudson said Reinking was detained after refusing to leave the restricted area, saying he wanted to meet President Donald Trump.State police in Illinois, where Reinking lived until last fall, subsequently revoked his state firearms card at the request of the FBI and four guns were then taken from him, including the AR-15 used in Sunday’s shooting as well as a handgun, authorities said.Sheriff Robert Huston in Tazewell County, Illinois, said deputies allowed Reinking’s father to take possession of the guns on the promise that he would “keep the weapons secure and out of the possession of Travis.” Huston added that, based on past deputies’ encounters with Reinking, “there’s certainly evidence that there’s some sort of mental health issues involved.”While Huston said it was unclear how Reinking reclaimed the guns, Nashville Police spokesman Don Aaron said that his father “has now acknowledged giving them back to his son.”Phone calls to a number listed for the father, Jeffrey Reinking, went unanswered.Meanwhile, authorities hailed the customer who intervened to stop a further bloodbath, 29-year-old James Shaw, Jr., as a hero — though the father of a 4-year-old girl demurred and said he was just trying to survive.One hand bandaged, Shaw told reporters he first thought the gunshots fired around 3:25 a.m. were plates falling from a dishwashing station.When he realized what was happening, he took cover behind a door as shots shattered windows. The gun either jammed or needed a new clip, and that’s when Shaw said he pounced after making up his mind that “he was going to have to work to kill me.”Shaw said he was not a religious man, but “for a tenth of a second, something was with me to run through that door and get the gun from him.”They cursed at each other as they scuffled, Shaw said, and he was able to grab the gun and toss it over a counter. The gunman then ran away into the dark of the working- and middle-class Antioch neighborhood of southeast Nashville.Authorities said he shed his jacket nearby and police found two AR-15 magazines loaded with bullets in the pockets. He was seen walking, naked, on a road, officials said, but later was spotted wearing pants but no shirt after apparently returning to his apartment.Another witness, Chuck Cordero, told The Tennessean newspaper he had stopped to get a cup of coffee and was outside the Waffle House when the chaos unfolded.“He did not say anything,” Cordero said of the gunman, who he described as “all business.”Cordero said Shaw saved lives. “There was plenty more people in that restaurant,” he said.The dead were identified as 29-year-old restaurant worker Taurean C. Sanderlin, and restaurant patrons Joe R. Perez, 20, Akilah Dasilva, 23, and Deebony Groves, 21. A police statement said Sanderlin and Perez were killed outside the restaurant, Groves was fatally shot inside, and Dasilva was critically wounded inside and later died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.Aaron, the police spokesman, said two of the wounded were being treated for gunshot wounds at the medical center, where spokeswoman Jennifer Wetzel said one was in critical condition and the other was in critical but stable condition.TriStar Southern Hills Medical Center spokeswoman Katie Radel in Nashville said two people were treated for minor injuries and released.Aaron said Reinking had been employed in construction and lived near the restaurant, and police used yellow crime scene tape to block public access to an apartment complex about a half-mile from the Waffle House. Reinking is originally from Morton, Illinois.“This is a very sad day for the Waffle House family,” the company said in a statement on Twitter. “We ask for everyone to keep the victims and their families in their thoughts and prayers.”Nashville Mayor David Briley described the shooting as “a tragic day” for the city.“My heart goes out to the families & friends of every person who was killed or wounded,” Briley said in an emailed statement. “I know all of their lives will be forever changed by this devastating crime.”U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper, whose district includes Nashville, said in an emailed statement that the shooting shows the need for tighter restrictions on “widespread civilian access to military-grade assault weapons.”Nashville Chief Anderson said there was no Tennessee law that would have barred Reinking from having guns, though weapons could be taken away if the suspect had serious mental health issues. That would require taking him to court and having his rights taken away because of illness, a sometimes lengthy and difficult process, Anderson said.Police reports filed in Illinois showed past run-ins with authorities there.In May 2016, Tazewell County deputies were called to a CVS parking lot where Reinking told officers that Taylor Swift was stalking him and hacking his phone, and that his family was also involved, according to a report released Sunday. Reinking agreed to go to a local hospital for an evaluation after repeatedly resisting the request, the report said.Another report from the sheriff’s office said Reinking barged into a community pool in Tremont, Illinois, last June and jumped into the water wearing a pink woman’s coat over his underwear. Investigators believed he had an AR-15 rifle in his car trunk, but it was never displayed. No charges were filed."
3adc362d6bda2a74c7a7950e54216ead,"Pyongyang cancelled ""at the last minute"" a meeting with US Vice President Mike Pence scheduled to be held during the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in South Korea, Washington has said.US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in a statement on Tuesday said that during Pence's visit, ""the possibility arose of a brief meeting with the North Korean delegation leaders,"" but at the last minute, the North Korean officials ""decided not to go forward with the meeting. We regret their failure to seize this opportunity,"" she said.Nauert's statement came after The Washington Post published an exclusive about North Korea cancelling the meeting with Pence.On February 10, less than two hours before Pence and his team were to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's sister Kim Yo-jong and North Korea's nominal head of state Kim Yong-nam, Pyongyang pulled out of the scheduled meeting, according to Pence's office.The North Korean decision to withdraw from the meeting came after Pence used his trip to denounce the North's nuclear ambitions and announce the ""toughest and most aggressive"" sanctions yet against the regime, while also taking steps to further solidify the US alliance with Japan and South Korea, the Post reported.The cancellation also came as the North Korean leader, through his sister, invited South Korean President Moon Jae-in to Pyongyang for talks.Kim's call for Moon to hold talks would likely cause consternation in Washington, where the Trump administration has been leading a campaign to put ""maximum pressure"" on the North Korean regime to give up its nuclear programme. Pence's actions and rhetoric in the run-up to the Olympics contrasted with the image of progress being promoted by the South Koreans, who would have been eager to involve the US in direct talks with the North.The North's state-run Korean Central News Agency had unleashed a torrent of vitriol against the Vice President, saying that ""Pence must know that his frantic acts of abusing the sacred Olympics for confrontational ruckus are as foolish and stupid an act as sweeping the sea with a broom"".Pence's stony demeanor and ramrod posture at the Opening Ceremonies earned snarky reviews in the South Korean media, with some grousing that he had snubbed the North Koreans and even disrespected the Olympic Games."

O’Brady and Rudd were competing to become the first to travel across Antarctica without getting new supplies or help from the wind.O’Brady won after he covered the last roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) in one big, impromptu final push to the finish line that took well over an entire day.“While the last 32 hours were some of the most challenging hours of my life, they have quite honestly been some of the best moments I have ever experienced,” O’Brady posted on Instagram, where he has been documenting the arduous journey.Rudd congratulated O’Brady on his blog late Wednesday.“I’ve just heard that the American Colin’s finished,” he wrote. “Fantastic, well done to him. He’d pushed really hard all the way across and done extremely well, so congratulations to him.”Rudd wrote that he never felt like he was in a race and that “it’s always been about completing the journey.”“That’ll be incredible,” he wrote.It’s been an emotional trek for Rudd, who decided to do the solo in honor of his close friend and fellow British explorer Henry Worsley, who died near the end of his attempt at an unassisted solo trek across Antarctica in 2016.2nd man nears end of historic solo trek across Antarctica2nd man nears end of historic solo trek across AntarcticaThough others have traversed Antarctica, they either had assistance with reinforced supplies or kites that helped propel them forward.O’Brady plans to stay on Antarctica until Rudd finishes his trek, said O’Brady’s wife, Jenna Besaw.“It’s a small club,” she joked. “His intention is to wait for Louis and have kind of a celebratory moment with the only other person on the planet to have accomplished this same thing.”O’Brady finished his trek as friends, family and fans tracked the endurance athlete’s progress in real time online.“I did it!” a tearful O’Brady said on a call to his family gathered in Portland for the holidays, according to Besaw.O’Brady, who had been told he may never walk again after an accident burned his legs in 2008, described in detail the ups and downs along the way since he began his Antarctic trek on Nov. 3.In the beginning, he had to haul 375 pounds (170 kilograms) of gear uphill and over sastrugi, wave-like ridges created by wind. By the end of the journey, his gear weighed roughly 140 pounds (64 kilograms).On Nov. 18, he wrote that he awoke to find his sled completely buried from an all-night blasting of wind and snow. That day he battled a 30 mph (48 kph) headwind for eight hours as he trudged along.“I wanted so badly to quit today as I was feeling exhausted and alone, but remembering all of the positivity that so many people have been sending, I took a deep breath and focused on maintaining forward progress one step at a time and managed to finish a full day,” he wrote.On Day 37, Dec. 9, O’Brady posted about how much he’s changed, along with a selfie in which he looks almost in pain, snow gathered around his furry hat.“I’m no longer the same person I was when I left on the journey, can you see it in my face?” he wrote. “I’ve suffered, been deathly afraid, cold and alone. I’ve laughed and danced, cried tears of joy and been awestruck with love and inspiration.”Though O’Brady had initially thought he’d want a cheeseburger at the end of his nearly impossible journey, Besaw said her husband has been fantasizing about fresh fish and salad because he has mostly been eating freeze-dried foods.As for what’s next for O’Brady, who also has summited Mount Everest, Besaw said she’s not entirely sure.“We are just so in the moment celebrating this right now,” she said. “Then we’ll see what’s next on the horizon.”"

e90c134fa3a30ca3e467733bd46cd0ab,"A bridge over the Ahr river is damaged in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, GermanyRescue workers labored to deal with damage laid bare by receding water Saturday as the death toll from disastrous flooding in Western Europe rose above 160 and thoughts turned to the lengthy job of rebuilding communities devastated in minutes.The death toll in western Germany’s Rhineland-Palatinate state, home to the badly hit Ahrweiler county, rose to 98. Another 43 people were confirmed dead in neighboring North Rhine-Westphalia state. Belgium’s national crisis center said the country’s confirmed death toll rose to 27.Days of heavy rain turned normally minor rivers and streets into raging torrents this week and caused the disastrous flooding that swept away cars, engulfed homes and trapped residents.Immediately after the floods hit on Wednesday and Thursday, German authorities listed large numbers of people as missing — something apparently caused in large part by confusion, multiple reporting and communications difficulties in the affected areas, some of which lacked electricity and telephone service.By Saturday, authorities still feared finding more people dead, but said numbers unaccounted for had dropped constantly, without offering specific figures. In Belgium, 103 people were listed as missing Saturday, but the crisis center said lost or uncharged cellphones and people taken to hospitals without identification who hadn’t had an opportunity to contact relatives were believed to be factors in the tally.Meanwhile, the receding floodwaters eased access across much of the affected regions and revealed the extent of the damage.“A lot of people have lost everything they spent their lives building up — their possessions, their home, the roof over their heads,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said after meeting rescue workers and others in the town of Erftstadt.“It may only be possible to clear up in weeks how much damage needs to be compensated,” he said.Steinmeier said that people in the affected areas need continuing support.“Many people here in these regions have nothing left but their hope, and we must not disappoint this hope,” he said.In Erftstadt, a town southwest of Cologne, a harrowing rescue effort unfolded on Friday when the ground in a neighborhood gave way. At least three houses and part of a mansion in the town’s Blessem district collapsed.The German military used armored vehicles to clear away cars and trucks overwhelmed by the floodwaters on a nearby road, some of which remained at least partly submerged. Officials feared that some people didn’t manage to escape in Erftstadt, but no casualties were confirmed by Saturday afternoon.In the Ahrweiler area, police warned of a potential risk from downed power lines and urged curious visitors to stay away. They complained on Twitter that would-be sightseers were blocking some roads.Around 700 people were evacuated from part of the German town of Wassenberg, on the Dutch border, after the breach of a dike on the Rur river.Visiting Erftstadt with Steinmeier, North Rhine-Westphalia governor Armin Laschet promised to organize aid for those immediately affected “in the coming days.” He said regional and federal authorities would discuss in the coming days how to help rebuilding efforts. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Cabinet plans to discuss the issue on Wednesday.“We will do everything so that what needs to be rebuilt can be rebuilt,” Laschet said.In eastern Belgium, many train lines and roads remained blocked.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo visited flood-damaged towns Saturday.A resident of the Belgian town of Herk-de-Stad said she put off sleeping to try to empty her house of water.“We have been pumping all night long trying to get the water out of the house,” Elke Lenaerts told broadcaster VTM.Parts of the southern Netherlands also experienced heavy flooding, though thousands of residents were allowed to return home after being evacuated on Thursday and Friday.Caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who visited the region on Friday, said that “first, there was corona, now these floods, and soon people will have to work on cleanup and recovery.”“It is disaster after disaster after disaster. But we will not abandon Limburg,” the southern province hit by the floods, he added. His government has declared the flooding a state of emergency, opening up national funds for those affected.Among other efforts to help the flood victims, the Hertog Jan brewery, which is based in the affected area, handed out 3,000 beer crates so locals could raise their belongings off the ground to protect them from the flooding.An emergency dike in the town of Horn didn’t hold and some houses were inundated. Authorities issued a warning to stay off the Maas River because of debris. Rescuers worked to save a cow stuck neck-deep in muddy water.At the other end of Germany, there was flooding Saturday evening following torrential rain in the Saechsische Schweiz area near Dresden and across the border in the Czech Republic.Roads, basements and railroad tracks flooded, disrupting train service between the Czech town of Decin and Bad Schandau, Germany. A summer camp for children on the Czech side had to be evacuated.In Austria, a flash flood swept through the town of Hallein, near the German border, late Saturday. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Twitter that heavy rain and storms were causing serious damage in several parts of Austria.“I thank all first responders and volunteers who are doing everything they can to help! We won’t leave those affected alone and will support the reconstruction,” he wrote."

In the video, medical staff at a hospital in the Imran Khan-led country are seen singing and dancing inside a hospital ward, while treating several COVID-19 patients. This comes at a time when the global death toll due to the novel coronavirus has crossed 1,14,000-mark and countries across the globe are struggling to find a cure to the deadly COVID-19. Bharatiya Janata Party MP Gautam Gambhir took to Twitter on Sunday and shared the video, which showed Pakistani doctors dancing inside a hospital ward while treating coronavirus patients. Captioning the video with lyrics title 'chitta chola', Gambhir wrote, ""coronavirus itself must listen to this..""The former cricketer has also used #NayaPakistan in this social media post, which is now gathering hilarious comments from over the world. Pakistan on Sunday reported 386 fresh coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of the COVID-19 patients in the country to 5,170.

It said the decision has been taken in order to protect the health and safety of all involved with the second presidential debate. However, President Trump, who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to a military hospital for four days for its treatment, refused to participate in the virtual debate.""I'm not going to do a virtual debate. I'm not going to waste my time at a virtual debate,"" Trump told Fox News in a telephonic interview soon after the independent and not-for-profit Commission announced changes in the format of the debate.Trump, who claimed victory over Biden in the first presidential debate, asserted that he expects to do the same in the Miami debate as well.""The commission changed the debate style and that's not acceptable to us. I beat him (Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden) in the first debate, I beat him easily,"" he said.Trump alleged that the Commission and everybody is trying to protect Biden.Joe Biden reacts to Trump's move Reacting to Trump's remarks, Biden said, ""I don't know what the president is going to do.

The largest Russian investment in India of $12.9 billion, which is also India’s largest FDI, was concluded last month in the oil sector between Rosneft and Essar,” she said at the India-Russia Business Dialogue at the Eastern Economic Forum held in Russia.“Politically, India has the best of relations with Russia. We have been partners for seven decades, and our friendship has expanded to almost all sectors of human activity,” Swaraj said. Terming the meeting as the start of a new and “promising” beginning in expanding India’s economic ties with the Russian Far East, Swaraj said the two countries should identify areas of common interest and encourage more interactions. “I see this as the start of a new and promising beginning in expanding India’s economic ties with the Russian Far East.I am confident that the Russian Government will assist Indian investors in the region,” Swaraj said in a statement. She also sought investment from the Russian business community. “I would like to reiterate our invitation to regions and businesspersons of the Far East to visit India, Greater trade, commerce and investment with the Far East will help us in achieving the target of $30 billion that we have set for our bilateral trade by the year 2025,” she said.“India is one of the most dynamic economies of the world. Based on the vibrant and progressive policies of our government, the Indian economy is firmly embarked on a strong growth trajectory. Ambitious policy measures such as the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax have made doing business in India easier,” Swaraj said. She said under the ‘Make in India’ and ‘Start-up India’ flagship programmes the government had made concerted efforts to attract technology, investments and best practices from across the world.“There has been no better time to engage with India. I can assure our Russian friends that in India, a warm welcome awaits them,” Swaraj said. She said the Russian Far East was one of the richest regions in the world and India is among the fastest growing large economies of the world. “There is lot that can be done together. When other markets are closing we need to find new ones and create virtuous cycles of investment. Investment is in the ultimate analysis (of) an act of faith,” she said.“Today, the Russian Far East authorities are actively inviting Indian investments into their region. The areas identified as priority sectors such as machine industry, oil and gas, fisheries, agriculture, metals and mining, diamonds, timber, transport and logistics and tourism are all of interest to India,” she added.Swaraj also said that India will provide an annual grant of $10,000 to fund the study of Indology at the Centre of Regional and International Studies at Far East Federal University. “This will contribute to building greater awareness about India and more exchanges,” she said."

China ratifies the UN convention on the law of the sea, yet builds artificial islands in disputed waters, he said.""China claims to champion the developing world, yet China's loans create debt traps and undermine sovereignty. The Chinese government pursues its goals by any means necessary, some are clearly illegal like economic espionage and computer intrusions.""Even those that appear legal often rely on deception, such as front companies or digital backdoors. Some are lawful but not reciprocal, exploiting the openness of free nations. That's why investigations and judicial actions are critical, but we need an even broader response to this threat,"" the FBI official said.According to John Demers, Assistant Attorney General, National Security Division in the Department of Justice, China is driven by a desire to be at the forefront of 10 critical technologies laid out in its 'Made in China' 2025 plan.""No one begrudges a nation that generates the most innovative ideas, and from them, develops the best technology, but we cannot tolerate a nation that steals the fruits of our brainpower, and that is just what China is doing to achieve its development goals,"" he said.China has turned the tradecraft of its intelligence services against American companies, taking trade secrets and other sensitive commercial information through computer intrusions and by co-opting company insiders, Demers alleged.""From underwater drones and autonomous vehicles to critical chemical compounds and inbred corn seeds, China has targeted advanced technology across sectors that align with China's publicly-announced strategic goals,"" he said.""The playbook is simple: rob, replicate and replace; Rob the American company of its intellectual property, replicate that technology and replace the American company in the Chinese market and one day in the global market.""It's no wonder that from 2011 to 2018, more than 90 per cent of the department's cases alleging economic espionage on behalf of a state involve China,"" Demers said.Christopher Krebs, Director, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security, said the US advise companies on the risks of doing business in a complex and unpredictable environment like China that includes forced technology transfer, limited transparency and a lack of privacy. In a globally integrated world, what happens over there can quickly impact operations here.Demers said the challenges being faced are exemplified by the case of Micron, a Boise, Idaho semiconductor company.Micron controls about 20 to 25 per cent of the USD 50 billion market for a basic kind of computer memory known as dynamic random access memory (DRAM). It's a critical component of a wide range of computer electronics. Until recently, the Chinese could not make DRAM; they had to buy it from companies like Micron, he said.In 2016, the Chinese authorities set out to change that. First, at the highest levels, the Chinese government publicly identified the development of integrated circuit technology, which includes DRAM, as a national economic priority, he said.Then it invested more than USD 5 billion to start up a company, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company, for the sole purpose of designing, developing and manufacturing integrated circuit chips, specifically DRAM, Demers said.And that same year, having never made a single computer chip, this company announced a partnership to manufacture DRAM with a Taiwan semi-conductor foundry known as UMC, he said.""There was only one problem: According to our indictment that we unsealed last month, neither company had ever made advanced DRAM. So how could they possibly manufacture it together less than a year after Fujian Jinhua had been founded?""According to the indictment, by luring Micron employees to steal trade secrets from Micron and bringing them to UMC, who would then transfer the technology to the Chinese state-owned enterprise, pursuant to the company's technology cooperation agreement,"" Demers added.(With PTI Inputs)"

df3fe5138832997d3450190c56c060d3,"People watch a TV showing an image of North Korea's missile launch during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in SeoulNorth Korea on Tuesday fired what appeared to be a ballistic missile into its eastern sea, its second weapons launch in a week, the militaries of South Korea and Japan said. This month's launches follow a series of weapons tests in 2021 that underscored how North Korea continues to expand its military capabilities amid a self-imposed pandemic lockdown and deadlocked nuclear talks with the United States.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North fired at least one weapon early Tuesday but didn't immediately say whether it was ballistic or how far it flew.Japan's Prime Minister's Office and Defence Ministry said the North Korean weapon was possibly a ballistic missile but didn't immediately provide more details.The Offices of Guam Homeland Security and Civil Defense said it was monitoring the reports of the North's launch but that no immediate threat was assessed for Guam, a major US military hub in the Pacific.The latest launch came six days after the North fired a ballistic missile into the sea in what it later described as a successful test of a hypersonic missile, a type of weaponry the North claimed to have first tested in September.That test came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a key political conference vowed to bolster his military forces despite pandemic-related difficulties.US-led diplomacy on North Korea's nuclear programme has been stalled since 2019 due to disputes over international sanctions on the North.The Biden administration has repeatedly called for resuming nuclear diplomacy “anywhere and at any time” without preconditions, but North Korea has argued the US must first withdraw its hostility against it before any talks can restart.The North's advancing nuclear arsenal is at the core of Kim's rule and what he clearly considers his strongest guarantee of survival.During his 10-year rule, he's conducted a large number of weapons tests in a push to acquire the ability to launch nuclear strikes on the American mainland.But his country's economy has faltered severely in the past two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US-led sanctions over his nuclear ambitions and his government's own mismanagement. (With inputs from AP)Also Read | North Korea says hypersonic missile launch to modernise weaponry successful   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

1f246632ceb0e89b5941a78ad1fa0beb,"Donald Trump/File ImagePresident Donald Trump is pulling all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria, officials announced Wednesday as the president suddenly declared victory over the Islamic State, contradicting his own experts’ assessments and sparking surprise and outrage from his party’s lawmakers who called his action rash and dangerous.The U.S. began airstrikes in Syria in 2014, and ground troops moved in the following year to battle the Islamic State, or ISIS, and train Syrian rebels in a country torn apart by civil war. Trump abruptly declared their mission accomplished in a tweet.“We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,” he said as Vice President Mike Pence met with top leaders at the Pentagon. U.S. officials said many details of the troop withdrawal had not yet been finalized, but they expect American forces to be out by mid-January.Later Wednesday, Trump posted a video on Twitter in which he said is “heartbreaking” to have to write letters and make calls to the loved ones of those killed in battle. “Now it’s time for our troops to come back home,” he said.A senior administration official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, said Trump made the decision based on his belief that U.S. troops have no role in Syria beyond combatting Islamic State, whose fighters are now believed to hold about 1 percent of the territory they did at the peak of their power.The president informed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of his decision in a telephone call, the official said. Turkey has recently warned that it would launch combat operations across its southern border into northeastern Syria against Kurdish forces who have been allied with the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State.Trump’s declaration of victory was far from unanimous, and officials said U.S. defense and military leaders were trying to dissuade him from ordering the withdrawal right up until the last minute. His decision immediately triggered demands from Congress — including leading Republicans — for more information and a formal briefing on the matter. Sen. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, just returned from Afghanistan, said he was meeting with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis late in the day.Graham, typically a Trump backer, said he was “blindsided” by the report and called the decision “a disaster in the making.” He said, “The biggest winners in this are ISIS and Iran.”The decision will fulfill Trump’s long-stated goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back for months, arguing that the IS group remains a threat and could regroup in Syria’s long-running civil war. U.S. policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated.The senior administration official said American forces would still work with allies to fight the Islamic State or other extremists in the country but gave no details on what that might entail.Another official said it still is not clear to defense leaders whether U.S. airstrikes against IS insurgents will continue in Syria after the American troops leave. U.S. military officials worry that American-backed Kurdish troops will be targeted by Turkey and the Syrian government, leaving no ally on the ground to help direct the strikes.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who remains concerned about Iranian efforts in the area, reacted in noncommittal fashion after talking with Trump by telephone.“This is, of course, an American decision,” he said. No matter what, he said, “we will safeguard the security of Israel and protect ourselves from this arena.”Leading Republican senators reacted with displeasure to the news.Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said the withdrawal would be a “grave error” and that Kurdish fighters will stop fighting the Islamic State when they must confront Turkish troops crossing the border into Syria.“This is a bad idea because it goes against the fight against ISIS and potentially helps ISIS,” he said, warning it could trigger a broader conflict in the region.Just last week, the U.S. special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition, Brett McGurk, said U.S. troops would remain in Syria even after the Islamic State was driven from its strongholds.“I think it’s fair to say Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring,” McGurk told reporters on Dec. 11. “Nobody is declaring a mission accomplished. Defeating a physical caliphate is one phase of a much longer-term campaign.”And two weeks ago Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. still has a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilize the country. He said it will take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of that number have been trained.Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said in September that the U.S. would keep a military presence in Syria as long as Iran was active there. “We’re not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias,” he said.James Stavridis, a former Navy admiral who served as top NATO commander, tweeted Wednesday that “Pulling troops out of Syria in an ongoing fight is a big mistake. Like walking away from a forest fire that is still smoldering underfoot. Big winner is Iran, then Russia, then Assad. Wrong move.”The withdrawal decision, however, is likely to be viewed positively by Turkey, and comes following several conversations between Trump and Erdogan over the past several weeks. The two spoke at the G-20 summit in Argentina and in a phone call last Friday.Erdogan said Monday he had gotten “positive answers” from Trump on the situation in northeast Syria where he has been threatening a new operation against the American-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters.Just hours before the withdrawal decision became public, the State Department announced late Tuesday that it had approved the sale of a $3.5 billion Patriot missile defense system to Turkey. The Turks had complained that the U.S. was slow walking requests for air defenses, and they had signed a deal with Russia to buy a sophisticated system in a deal that Washington and Ankara’s other NATO partners strongly opposed.Completion of that deal with Russia for the S-400 system would have opened up Turkey to possible U.S. sanctions and driven a major wedge between the allies. It was not immediately clear if there was a connection between the Patriot sale and the decision on U.S. troops.Although the withdrawal decision doesn’t signal an end to the American-led coalition’s fight against the Islamic State, it will likely erode U.S. leadership of that 31-nation effort. The administration had been preparing to host a meeting of coalition foreign ministers early next year.“The bottom line is that the American withdrawal from eastern Syria will create a power vacuum that will lead to a new phase of international conflict in Syria,” said Jennifer Cafarella, a Syria expert at the Institute for the Study of War.She predicted that the Russians, the Iranians, Syrian President Bashar Assad and the Turks will compete for the terrain and resources previously under U.S. control “at the expense of” the Syrian Kurds who have partnered with U.S. forces against IS."
25ffd5593c0198282419ccd23257c59b,"China to showcase 'advanced weapons' at its biggest military parade on October 1China will hold its biggest military parade showcasing some of the most ""advanced weapons"", including the nuclear arsenal, on October 1 as part of the 70th year of National Day celebration to demonstrate its enhanced deterrence and growing military might to the world.China would put on a grand celebration, followed by a military parade and mass pageantry at Tian'anmen Square on October 1, the National Day, to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), official media reported here on Thursday.Some advanced weapons will make their debut in the military parade, the scale of which is scheduled to be greater than the ones commemorating the 50th and 60th founding anniversary of the PRC, as well as the V-Day military parade in 2015, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.The military parade is expected to showcase China's achievements in building its national defence and armed forces in the past 70 years and reflect the outcomes of the reform of the people's armed forces Cai Zhijun, deputy head of the office of the leading group for the military parade, told the media.The military parade is an important part of the National Day celebration and is not aimed at any other countries or specific situations, Cai said, playing down reports that the display weapons were aimed at showcasing its military might especially to the US and the countries around.In the parade, China plans to show its strategic nuclear missiles and advanced fighter jets, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported. Military analysts said the show of nuclear strength was intended to demonstrate China’s enhanced deterrence and second-strike capability, especially to the United States. ""The parade is to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1. So it should let the whole world see China's achievement of military modernisation under the leadership of President Xi Jinping since he came to power [in 2012],"" the Post quoted a Chinese military official as saying.He said weapon systems such as DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missiles and J-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles have already been moved to Beijing to join the parade. A squadron of J-20 jets, the country's first stealth fighter, is also preparing for the event.The DF-41 is capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads and its range of at least 12,000-km means it can hit any target on the US mainland, the report said. The JL-2, which has a shorter range of 7,000-km, is also able to hit parts of the American continent when launched from the sea.Hong Kong-based military analyst Song Zhongping said it was likely that Beijing would want to use the parade to send a “warning message” to the US in light of the continuing tensions between the two countries.""China has invested a lot of resources into military science and technology development in a bid to enhance its nuclear deterrence capability over the past years, which Beijing believes represents a strategic measure in countering the global military hegemony [of the US],"" Song was quoted as saying by Post. He noted that the US has started making new low-yield warheads for its Trident missiles which ""lowered the threshold on the use of tactical nuclear weapons"".Adam Ni, a researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, said that the coming parade would provide a good opportunity for China to show off the breadth of its strategic nuclear deterrent.""The deployment of DF-41 is a big step for China's nuclear deterrence because it is a more powerful ICBM with greater range and [can carry] more warheads and boasts advanced technology,"" he said."

With 99.2 percent of ballots counted, Erdogan received more than half of the votes required to secure an outright victory. The elections were of crucial importance because whoever won will also be able to enjoy enhanced powers in addition to that of a president under a new constitutional law agreed in an April 2017 referendum.Related Stories Turkey's parliament to debate greater powers for ErdoganTurkey referendum: President Erdogan declares victoryTurkish President Erdogan to start new diplomatic blitz with India visitErdogan defeated his nearest rival Muharrem Ince with an ""absolute majority"" of more than half the vote without needing a second round, said the chief of Turkey's election authority, Sadi Guven. Erdogan won 52.5 per cent in the presidential poll while Ince, of the secular Republican People's Party (CHP), was on 31.5 per cent.""I have been entrusted by the nation with the task and duties of the presidency,"" Erdogan said in a victory address at his Istanbul residence, vowing that the new presidential system would be implemented ""rapidly"".Erdogan also declared victory for the People's Alliance, a bloc between his ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), saying they had won a parliamentary majority in the legislative elections, also held on Sunday.But Ince, who had faced limited airtime on television in the campaign and a near boycott by state media, said the run-up to the election had been unfair.Ince vowed to ""continue our fight until Turkey is a Turkey for everyone"", expressing alarm over the powers Erdogan assumes under the new system which he described as ""a one-man regime"".Meanwhile, prominent world leaders congratulated Erdogan for his stupendous victory.

The official, on the condition of anonymity, was responding to a question on the position of the US on the Kashmir issue after Trump last week offered to be the ""mediator"" between India and Pakistan on the issue during his meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan at the White House.India firmly rejected Trump's offer, saying that New Delhi's consistent position has been that all outstanding issues with Pakistan are discussed only bilaterally. ""On Kashmir as I said, we would all like to see improved relations between India and Pakistan. That’s why you heard the president’s offer of assistance,” the official said.“We recognise that Kashmir has been a bilateral issue but there are opportunities as Pakistan takes steps that build confidence in its own efforts to counter terrorism for their ultimately towards constructive dialogue. We stand ready to assist if asked by the parties to do so,” the official said.The official said the US welcomes Khan's stated commitment that Pakistan for its own future will prevent the operation of all terror groups on its territory. Pakistan Prime Minister's visit to the US, the official said, was a chance for Khan to discuss how his government will bring his vision for both sides to confer on how the US can support Pakistan in this endeavour.""Of the US ability to encourage a constructive dialogue between India and Pakistan, whether on Kashmir or other bilateral issues will be a function of Pakistan taking sustained and irreversible steps against militants and terrorists on its territory,"" the official said. ""We support Pakistan's national action plan formed by all political parties after the horrific Peshawar school attack as well as Prime Minister Khan’s personal commitment that no militant groups should be able to operate from Pakistani soil,” the official said.""Obviously it's in everyone's interest to see improvement of relations between India and Pakistan. And the president's offer was made in recognition of that fact,” the official said.According to the official, Pakistan Army chief General Bajwa accompanying Prime Minister Khan during the US visit sends an important message of civilian-military unity on issues of regional stability, counter-terrorism and meeting the reform requirements of the IMF programme. Both Prime Minister Khan and President Trump are keen to expand trade and investment, which benefit both of the countries, he said."
d86b359249f40c597a6a38faf54cadcd,"The multi-billion dollar China- Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will deepen China's already formidable presence in the South Asian nation, and ""aggravate"" tension between India and Pakistan, a US think-tank said today.""CPEC will deepen China's already formidable presence in the country and clearly aggravate India-Pakistan tensions. In addition, real questions persist about Pakistan's ability to finance its share of new energy investment,"" Michael Kugelman, deputy director and senior associate for South Asia Program at the Wilson Center said in a report published today.According to him, even though the CPEC may enable Pakistan to generate more power, it will not solve the country's broader energy crisis, which is rooted in factors that go well beyond supply shortages.""Stability in Pakistan's security situation and economic performance is increasingly in critical interest for Beijing because it is a precondition for CPEC's success. Given New Delhi's strenuous opposition, CPEC will exacerbate India- Pakistan tensions,"" Kugelman wrote.Among other things, CPEC cements the already deep presence of Washington's top strategic competitor in a region where the US has a much lighter footprint, he said.""The project also generates additional obstacles for the Indian efforts to access markets and natural gas reserves in Central Asia — a region that India cannot reach directly by land because Pakistan denies its transit rights on Pakistani soil,"" he said.According to Kugelman, Beijing's messaging is very similar to Islamabad's — it uses only the most positive of rhetoric and with a triumphant and confident tone. Like Pakistan, China has much at stake, he said.As per the report, CPEC is in some ways a test case of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) because it includes some of the initiative's first projects to become fully operational.""Privately, however, China worries about the security risks to CPEC, even as terrorist violence has subsided in Pakistan since 2014, when the Pakistani military launched a major counterterrorism offensive,"" the report said, adding that many of the attacks that have taken place since then have occurred along or on envisioned CPEC routes in Baluchistan.Separatist rebels have targeted energy infrastructure in the province for a number of years and remain an active threat.""Furthermore, criminal gangs pose threats to CPEC projects in Punjab Province. One such outfit, known as the Chotu Gang, abducted 12 Chinese engineers working on a highway project in Punjab back in 2005,"" he wrote.Kugelman said in private conversations, Pakistani officials and analysts offer a sobering appraisal of the project.""Privately, Pakistanis also express concern about the country's ability to pay back loans in the coming years, as well as about the security threats ranging from terrorism and separatist insurgency to organized crime that threaten CPEC construction,"" he said.Referring to India's reaction to CPEC, Kugelman said New Delhi's biggest objection to CPEC is that it entails building projects in Gilgit-Baltistan.""New Delhi does not formally oppose BRI as a whole; rather, its stated concerns are restricted to CPEC, which it has described as a violation of Indian sovereignty, he noted."

46692f7d3dd37807b1871c8aa4e9af70,"The Merck corporate headquarters in Kenilworth, N.J. Britain has granted a conditional authorization to Merck's coronavirus antiviral, the first pill shown to successfully treat COVID-19. Britain has granted conditional authorization to Merck's coronavirus antiviral, the first pill shown to successfully treat COVID-19. It is the first country to OK the treatment, although it was not immediately clear how quickly the pill would be available.The pill was licensed for adults 18 and older who have tested positive for COVID-19 and have at least one risk factor for developing severe disease. The drug, known as molnupiravir, is intended to be taken twice a day for five days by people at home with mild to moderate COVID-19.An antiviral pill that reduces symptoms and speeds recovery could prove groundbreaking, easing caseloads on hospitals and helping to curb outbreaks in poorer countries with fragile health systems. It would also bolster the two-pronged approach to the pandemic: treatment, by way of medication, and prevention, primarily through vaccinations.Molnupiravir is also pending review at regulators in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced last month it would convene a panel of independent experts to scrutinize the pill's safety and effectiveness in late November.Initial supplies will be limited. Merck has said it can produce 10 million treatment courses through the end of the year, but much of that supply has already been purchased by governments worldwide.In October, U.K. officials announced they secured 480,000 courses of molnupiravir and expected thousands of vulnerable Britons to have access to the treatment this winter via a national study.“Today is a historic day for our country, as the UK is now the first country in the world to approve an antiviral that can be taken at home for COVID-19,"" said Britain's health secretary, Sajid Javid.“We are working at pace across the government and with the NHS to set out plans to deploy molnupiravir to patients through a national study as soon as possible,"" he said in a statement, referring to the U.K.'s National Health Service. Doctors said the treatment would be particularly significant for people who do not respond well to vaccination.Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutic have requested clearance for the drug with regulators around the world to treat adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for severe disease or hospitalization. That's roughly the same group targeted for treatment with infused COVID-19 antibody drugs, the standard of care in many countries for patients who don't yet require hospitalization.Merck announced preliminary results last month showing its drug cut hospitalizations and deaths by half among patients with early COVID-19 symptoms. The results have not yet been vetted by outside scientists.The company also did not disclose details on molnupiravir’s side effects, except to say that rates of those problems were similar between people who got the drug and those who received dummy pills.The drug targets an enzyme the coronavirus uses to reproduce itself, inserting errors into its genetic code that slow its ability to spread and take over human cells. That genetic activity has led some independent experts to question whether the drug could potentially cause mutations leading to birth defects or tumors.In company trials, both men and women were instructed to either use contraception or abstain from sex. Pregnant women were excluded from the study. Merck has stated that the drug is safe when used as directed.Molnupiravir was initially studied as a potential flu therapy with funding from the U.S. government. Last year, researchers at Emory University decided to repurpose the drug as a potential COVID-19 treatment. They then licensed the drug to Ridgeback and its partner Merck.Last week, Merck agreed to allow other drugmakers to make its COVID-19 pill, in a move aimed at helping millions of people in poorer countries get access. The Medicines Patent Pool, a United Nations-backed group, said Merck will not receive royalties under the agreement for as long as the World Health Organization deems COVID-19 to be a global emergency.But the deal was criticized by some activists for excluding many middle-income countries capable of making millions of treatments, including Brazil and China.Still, experts commended Merck for agreeing to widely share its formula and promising to help any companies who need technological help in making their drug — something no coronavirus vaccine producers have agreed to.“Unlike the grotesquely unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the poorest countries will not have to wait at the back of the queue for molnupiravir,” said Dr. Mohga Kamal-Yanni, a senior health adviser to the People's Vaccine Alliance. Fewer than 1% of the world's COVID-19 vaccines have gone to poor countries and experts hope easier-to-dispense treatments will help them curb the pandemic.Previously Merck announced licensing deals with several Indian generic drugmakers to manufacture lower-cost versions of the drug for developing countries.The U.S. reportedly paid roughly $700 per course of molnupiravir, for about 1.7 million treatments. Merck says it plans to use a tiered pricing strategy for developing countries. A review by Harvard University and King's College London estimated the drug costs about $18 to make.While other treatments have been cleared to treat COVID-19, including steroids and monoclonal antibodies, those are administered by injection or infusion and are mostly for hospitalized patients.ALSO READ | US to lift restrictions for fully vaccinated travelers from November 8; new guidelines issued   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_3720249945 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_891xy09i/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_891xy09i_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Taliban stop 140 Afghan Hindu-Sikh pilgrims from travelling to India"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""268"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_3720249945 = ''; jwsetup_3720249945(); function jwsetup_3720249945() { jwvidplayer_3720249945 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_3720249945"").setup(jwconfig_3720249945); jwvidplayer_3720249945.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_3720249945, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_891xy09i\"", ns_st_pr=\""Taliban stop 140 Afghan Hindu-Sikh pilgrims from travelling to India\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Taliban stop 140 Afghan Hindu-Sikh pilgrims from travelling to India\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Taliban stop 140 Afghan Hindu-Sikh pilgrims from travelling to India\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-08-26\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-08-26\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_891xy09i/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_3720249945.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_3720249945.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_3720249945.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_3720249945.stop(); jwvidplayer_3720249945.remove(); jwvidplayer_3720249945 = ''; jwsetup_3720249945(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_3720249945.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_3720249945.stop(); jwvidplayer_3720249945.remove(); jwvidplayer_3720249945 = ''; jwsetup_3720249945(); return; }); jwvidplayer_3720249945.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_3720249945.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_3720249945.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_3720249945.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_3720249945.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_3720249945.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

Those arriving from mainland China were required to isolate at home since last month.Lam also announced that full resumption of school classes on April 20 was ""quite impossible"" and the government would continue to not organise any large-scale events.""If we do not impose tougher measures at this stage, our previous efforts to prevent the disease from spreading throughout these two months could be completely wasted,"" the Chief Executive told the media.She said that most of the cases confirmed in the previous two weeks in Hong Kong involved patients who had recently been abroad.The new cases took the city's tally to 158, including a suspected case, while the death toll stood at four.""If all these imported cases lead to a community outbreak, the consequence will be unimaginable and increase the burden on the public health system,"" the South China Morning Post quoted Lam as saying.While announcing the new measure, she did not reveal a date for how long they would be in place.""This will be a prolonged battle.

The cult attracted many young people, even graduates of top universities, some of whom Asahara hand-picked as close aides.The group amassed an arsenal of chemical, biological and conventional weapons to carry out Asahara's escalating criminal orders in anticipation of an apocalyptic showdown with the government.During his eight-year trial, Asahara talked incoherently, occasionally babbling in broken English, and never acknowledged his responsibility or offered meaningful explanations.He was on death row for about 14 years. His family has said he was a broken man, constantly wetting and soiling the floor of his prison cell and not communicating with his family or lawyers.Some survivors of the cult's crimes opposed the executions, saying they would end hopes for a fuller explanation of the crimes.Shizue Takahashi, whose husband was a subway deputy station master who died in the attack, also expressed regret that six of Asahara's followers had been killed.""I wanted the others to talk more about what they did as lessons for anti-terrorism measures in this country, and I wanted the authorities and experts to learn more from them,"" she told a televised news conference. ""I regret that is no longer possible.""The cult claimed 10,000 members in Japan and 30,000 in Russia. It has disbanded, though nearly 2,000 people follow its rituals in three splinter groups, monitored by authorities.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Suga said authorities are taking precautionary measures in case of any retaliation by his followers."

9554f23d98d0e067d2689f29a8b635ef,"Biden administration goes into mission mode to help India fight COVID19The Biden administration seems to have adopted a mission mode approach and removed all bureaucratic hurdles to help India in its fight against deadly COVID-19 pandemic that has spread like wildfire across the country. India is struggling with a second wave of the pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals in several states are reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds. Various wings of the US government, including the Department of Defence, Department of Health and Human Resources, the State Department, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and US Trade Representatives have been activated to not only identify India’s need but also to remove all the bureaucratic hurdles and ensure that all medical requirements start being airlifted to India as soon as possible. “We are in close touch with Indian officials at all levels. We are also closely coordinating with our allies, friends, and Quad partners about how we can collectively support India in its hour of need,” a senior administration official told reporters, soon after President Joe Biden had a telephonic conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As requested by the Indian government, the US will be providing raw materials for the production of the Covishield vaccine at the Serum Institute of India, a second senior official said. “Given that there is not enough of the supply for the entire global manufacturing effort and in light of the current crisis, we, the United States, are diverting our order to India,” the official said.“We did not intervene with the manufacturer to make them fill the Serum Institute's order; we don't have that power. Instead, what we are doing is diverting our own order of our own supplies to the Serum Institute for their manufacturing,” the official explained.USAID and CDC will provide technical assistance and materials, and strengthen vaccine communications related to confidence in vaccination, and support of vaccine readiness at the national and subnational levels.Observing that India was facing a huge surge right now, a third senior official said that there's a lot of support that the Biden administration is currently exploring and what they will provide that will be helpful on the ground immediately.“At India’s request, we're exploring options to provide oxygen and related supplies. These are resources that India has specifically requested and are very high on their priority list.,” the official said.The Department of Defence and US Agency for International Development are pursuing options to provide oxygen generation systems. According to the official, the Department of Defence is working on oxygen generation systems, including larger-scale as well as smaller-scale units. They are also exploring the provision of field oxygen generation systems, which the US has used in its own field hospitals to provide oxygen for 50 to 100 beds.“They are shorter- and longer-term options that we're providing in the immediate, and then we plan to continue to be engaged over the longer term,” the official said. The Pentagon is also exploring options to provide oxygen concentrations and ventilators.The US is in technical discussions with India to ensure that the equipment that US supplies will connect to devices in India. The US will also provide training associated with all of these requests as needed.“The US government is also preparing to help with transportation of these and other supplies to India,” said the official. The administration has identified US commercial suppliers of remdesivir that are immediately available to help relieve the suffering of COVID-19 patients in India. It has identified rapid diagnostic testing supplies, as well as personal protective equipment, that will be available to be transferred to India immediately, the official said.Further, the CDC, working with USAID, will urgently deploy a strike team to India which will include public health experts to work in close collaboration with the US embassy in New Delhi, with India's health ministries and experts, and with India's Epidemic Intelligence Service staff.That strike team will work hand in hand with India's experts in a number of areas, including laboratory services; surveillance and epidemiology; bioinformatics for sequencing and modelling of the disease; infection, prevention, and control; vaccines rollout; and risk communication, the official said.The USAID will also work in the public health arena with CDC to support and fast track the mobilisation of emergency resources available through the Global Fund. India's base allocation through the Global Funds COVID-19 resource mobilisation round is USD75 million, the official noted. Finally, in the broader healthcare service support and supply chain and manufacturing assistance, the United States is offering assistance to also help with the supply chain of oxygen and related healthcare supplies. Noting that AstraZeneca vaccine is not approved for use in the US, the official said the United States is looking at options to share these doses with other countries as they become available. “Importantly, though, before any AstraZeneca doses can be shipped from the United States, the FDA will confirm that any such doses meet its expectations for product quality. This is being done in the context of FDA’s ongoing review of all doses made at the plant where these AstraZeneca doses were produced,” said the official. Also Read: India was there for us and we will be there for them: Biden after talks with PM Modi"
fdb3afbc291003952fbe7b0c30aa8223,"Islamic extremists opened fire on the French Embassy and army headquarters in separate attacks in Burkina Faso’s capital Friday, killing at least seven soldiers, while eight of the militants were slain, a government official said.More than 90 people were wounded in the violence in the former French colony in West Africa, and officials called it a terrorist attack. There was no claim of responsibility.Five emergency centers were set up in hospitals, a military barracks and at a stadium in Ouagadougou to treat the casualties, said Col. Amade Kafando, director general of Burkina Faso’s army health department. There were fears that the death toll could rise.Gunfire and explosions resounded for hours but subsided by midday. Workers fled offices near the site of the violence, and helicopters were seen above the embassy.Witnesses at state TV offices that face the embassy told The Associated Press that five attackers arrived in a pickup truck, shouted, “Allahu Akhbar,” and began shooting. They also set fire to the truck, the witnesses added.The neighborhood also houses other embassies, the prime minister’s office and U.N. offices. The French Foreign Ministry later said the situation near the embassy had stabilized.Across central Ouagadougou to the west, heavy smoke rose from the army joint chief of staff’s office, where witnesses reported loud explosions. Windows were broken there and in the surrounding buildings.The assailants there also arrived in a pickup and starting shooting at soldiers, said Moussa Korbeogo, a trader at a nearby market.“Some of the soldiers ran into a nearby bank to seek shelter. Several were killed outside and inside the premises,” Korbeogo said.Five of the extremists were killed at the embassy and at least three were killed near the army headquarters, according to Communications Minister Remy Danguinou.The Paris prosecutor’s office said it has opened a preliminary attempted murder investigation into the attack because the embassy was among the targets, a judicial official said on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to the media identified.It was not clear how many militants took part in what Jean Bosco Kienou, director general of Burkina Faso’s police, and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe called a terrorist attack.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement that Burkina Faso’s security forces had received the support of the French to “reduce the threat.” He said the safety of French citizens in Ouagadougou “is my priority.”The ministry’s website recommended that people stay off the streets and remain in a safe place.The landlocked nation of Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world. It shares a northern border with Mali, which has long battled Islamic extremists.Ouagadougou has been attacked by Islamic extremists targeting foreigners at least twice in the past few years.In August, extremists opened fire as patrons dined at a restaurant, killing at least 18 people. In January 2016, Islamic extremists attacked another cafe popular with foreigners, killing 30 people.Security forces struggled to contain the attacks.Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility for the 2016 killings along with the jihadist group known as Al Mourabitoun. But the terror threat in Burkina Faso is increasingly homegrown, experts say.The northern border region near Mali is the home of a local preacher, Ibrahim Malam Dicko, who has claimed responsibility for recent deadly attacks on troops and civilians. His association, Ansarul Islam, is considered a terrorist group by Burkina Faso’s government.Among his objectives has been ending the use of French, the former colonizer’s language, in regional schools. Forces backed by the French military have failed to capture Dicko.But he is not the only threat. Northern areas near the border with Mali have been a regular target of attacks by various extremist groups, some of them vowing to step up deadly assaults in response to the recent deployment of a regional G5 Sahel force. The 5,000-member force combines troops from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Chad and Mauritania, with France leading the efforts to bring in international funding.The countries’ troops join forces where they can. In response to the new violence in eastern Burkina Faso, troops from Burkina Faso and nearby Mali and Niger have increased patrols. Extremists are thought to be hiding in forested areas in the border region.Longtime President Blaise Compaore was ousted in a popular uprising in late 2014, and a coup was mounted the following year but ultimately failed. Some critics say the military has suffered during the years of political upheaval.During the 2016 assault, security forces waited for hours before trying to intervene.Threats by Islamic extremists also moved into new parts of Burkina Faso in February with an attack by 10 people in an eastern town that killed an officer and wounded two others.Increased attacks at the border with Mali have forced thousands to flee in the past year. An Australian doctor who had spent decades treating civilians was also abducted along this border and remains missing."
528db6b30ac01d51084eb7bc8b903d3d,"Jallianwala BaghFor the first time in its history, Pakistan has put on display rare documents of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre to mark its 100th anniversary.The six-day exhibition showcasing about 70 historical documents related to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and Martial Law in Punjab in April 1919 opened at the Lahore Heritage Museum here on Saturday. A year earlier, Pakistan had exhibited the archives of the trial of revolutionary leader Bhagat Singh in Lahore.The massacre took place at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar (undivided Punjab) during the Baisakhi festival on April 13, 1919, when troops of the British Indian Army under the command of Colonel Reginald Dyer opened fire at a crowd of people holding a pro-independence demonstration, leaving scores dead.""The government has decided to showcase archives of different historical events and famous personalities so that people could know what had happened during that period,"" Abbas Chughtai, Pakistan's Punjab province government's archive department director, told PTI.Chughtai said that the archived documents are displayed to mark the massacre's centenary year and the practice will continue in coming days as well. ""We are also planning to exhibit the documents related to the work of Rudyard Kipling,"" he said. ""We urge people to visit the Lahore Heritage Museum and go through the pages of history,"" he said, adding that the exhibition will go on till April 26.The documents include different number of Martial Law Order, copy of the ordinance regarding continuance of trials held by Commissions and Summary Courts, expulsion order of 47 students of different colleges of Lahore in connection with disturbances and a copy of the questions raised by Lord Sydenhamin House of Lords, England about sentence passed by martial law commission to Muhammad Bashir, whose proclamation was an immediate cause in bringing a large mob to Jallianwala Bagh on April 13, 1919.A copy of assistant commissioner Murree's letter about sending European and Anglo Indians to Murree from Lahore for their safety during the disturbances, a copy of the report about outbreak of disturbances in Lahore, Amritsar, Kasur, Ahmadabad and Patna and the Rawalpindi governor’s letter to the chief secretary to declare martial law in Jehlum to teach the people discipline as a punishment for throwing stone on Mr Barton’s car, the deputy commissioner of Rawalpindi also features the exhibition.About the death toll in the massacre, the 3rd September letter of deputy commissioner Amritsar in the documents reported the final figure of death at Jallianwala Bagh to 291 including two women and five children, a copy of notice both in Urdu and Hindi language informing them about how many were killed in the massacre, a letter of the deputy commissioner informing bout whipping of school boys in Lahore."
e207be634c755c1d1f6255f3812f7dd6,"Heat, soap, alcohol treatment effective against COVID variants. Covid-19 variants have a similar surface stability as the wild type virus under laboratory conditions, but can be effectively eliminated by disinfection and thorough hand washing, heat or alcohol treatment, German researchers have found.The team, led by researchers of the Ruhr-Universitat Bochum (RUB), analysed how long the variants remain infectious on surfaces made of steel, silver, copper and on face masks and how they can be rendered harmless by means of soap, heat or alcohol.It turned out that both variants, as well as the wild type virus, could be inactivated when treated with at least 30 per cent alcohol for at least 30 seconds.""Common disinfectants are therefore effective against all these variants,"" said Stephanie Pfander from the RUB.Hand washing with soap could also lower the risk of infection. Heat also works against the virus: after 30 minutes at 56 degrees Celsius, all variants were rendered harmless, Pfander added.To find out whether the stability of the different mutant variants on surfaces differs from each other, the team analysed the amount of infectious virus particles on surfaces made of steel, copper, silver and on surgical and FFP2 masks over 48 hours.""The surface stability did not differ between the virus variants,"" said Eike Steinmann from the Department for Molecular and Medical Virology at RUB. ""As described several times before, copper in particular has a very strong anti-viral effect"".The results, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, did not detect any differences between the different mutants in terms of their sensitivity to different hygiene measures.The fact that viruses change genetically over time is well known. Variants of concern are those that give the virus an advantage, for example by allowing it to replicate faster, become more infectious or enable it to evade the immune response.The British and South African variants have accumulated several mutations which result in an increased transmission and, in some cases, lead to more severe courses of disease.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_1939929969 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/05/0_msgbl0x4/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_msgbl0x4_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": "" BJP blames Congress over 'toolkit' defaming PM Modi, BJP on Covid mismanagement | Watch Muqabla"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""2677"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_1939929969 = ''; jwsetup_1939929969(); function jwsetup_1939929969() { jwvidplayer_1939929969 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_1939929969"").setup(jwconfig_1939929969); jwvidplayer_1939929969.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_1939929969, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_msgbl0x4\"", ns_st_pr=\""BJP blames Congress over 'toolkit' defaming PM Modi, BJP on Covid mismanagement | Watch Muqabla\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""BJP blames Congress over 'toolkit' defaming PM Modi, BJP on Covid mismanagement | Watch Muqabla\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""BJP blames Congress over 'toolkit' defaming PM Modi, BJP on Covid mismanagement | Watch Muqabla\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-05-19\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-05-19\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/05/0_msgbl0x4/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_1939929969.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_1939929969.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_1939929969.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_1939929969.stop(); jwvidplayer_1939929969.remove(); jwvidplayer_1939929969 = ''; jwsetup_1939929969(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_1939929969.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_1939929969.stop(); jwvidplayer_1939929969.remove(); jwvidplayer_1939929969 = ''; jwsetup_1939929969(); return; }); jwvidplayer_1939929969.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1939929969.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1939929969.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1939929969.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1939929969.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1939929969.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

It has also launched massive military drills in Belarus, an ally that also borders Ukraine.Russia denies it has any plans to invade Ukraine, and Lavrov argued that Moscow should hold more talks, despite the West’s refusal to consider Russia’s main demands.The talks “can’t go on indefinitely, but I would suggest to continue and expand them at this stage,” Lavrov said, noting that Washington has offered to discuss limits for missile deployments in Europe, restrictions on military drills and other confidence-building measures.Moscow wants guarantees that NATO will not allow Ukraine and other former Soviet countries to join as members. It also wants the alliance to halt weapons deployments to Ukraine and roll back its forces from Eastern Europe.(With inputs from AP)ALSO READ | Russia-Ukraine news: India asks its nationals, students to consider leaving Ukraine temporarily"

0861da6f1cc7cb25e4bdc6feddf78281,"China announces new rules for Muslims visiting Saudi Arabia for HajChina has released new regulations for Muslims visiting Saudi Arabia for annual Haj stipulating that the pilgrimage should be organised only by the country's Islamic Association and pilgrims should follow Chinese laws and oppose religious extremism.There are 20 million Muslims in China, mostly Uyghurs - an ethnic group of Turkic origin - and Hui Muslims, who are of Chinese ethnic origin. Both Uyghurs and Hui Muslims have a population of about 10 million each, according to an official white paper.About 10,000 Chinese Muslims perform Haj every year.The new regulation issued for Haj pilgrimage has a total of 42 articles, including one that stipulates that Chinese Muslims' pilgrimage should be organised in accordance with laws, and the Chinese Islamic Association is the only organisation that is authorised to arrange for Chinese Muslims to go to Mecca in Saudi Arabia to perform Haj.No other organisation or individual should organise the trips, and Chinese citizens should meet basic requirements when applying for the Haj, the regulation, which would be implemented from December 1, stipulates, state-run Global Times reported.People who go overseas to perform Haj should abide by China's and the destination country's laws and regulations, and oppose religious extremism, according to the regulations.The related government departments are requested to fulfil their responsibilities and ban illegal Haj activities, the report said.The Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam which every Muslim is required to complete at least once in their lifetime if they are healthy enough and have the means to do so.China since last year faced severe international criticism, including from the UN and western countries, over allegations that it is holding over a million people, mostly ethnic Uyghurs, in internment camps in Muslim-majority Xinjiang province in a bid to wean them away from religious extremism.Resource-rich Xinjiang province is home to over 10 million Turkic speaking Uighur Muslims. The province is restive for several years over settlements of Han Chinese in the region.China defends the camps, describing the facilities as re-education centres aimed at de-radicalising sections of the Uyghur Muslim population from extremism and separatism. "
3108f95346c971f4cb433e10bb1ff24e,"COVID-19 pandemic will lead to over 28 million cancelled surgeries worldwide: StudyMore than 28 million planned surgeries across the world could be cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to patients facing a lengthy wait for their health issues to be resolved, according to a study. The CovidSurg Collaborative, a 120-country research initiative formed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on surgeries, has projected that, based on a 12-week period of peak disruption to hospital services due to COVID-19, around 28.4 million elective surgeries worldwide will cancelled or postponed in 2020, the researchers said.The modelling study, published in the British Journal of Surgery, indicates that each additional week of disruption to hospital services will be associated with a further 2.4 million cancellations.Led by researchers from the University of Birmingham, the study collected detailed information from surgeons across 359 hospitals and 71 countries on plans for cancellation of elective surgery.This data was then statistically modelled to estimate totals for cancelled surgery across 190 countries.The researchers project that worldwide 72.3 per cent of planned surgeries would be cancelled through the peak period of COVID-19 related disruption, adding that most cancelled surgeries will be for non-cancer conditions.Orthopaedic procedures will be cancelled most frequently, with 6.3 million orthopaedic surgeries cancelled worldwide over a 12-week period, according to the researchers.It is also projected that globally 2.3 million cancer surgeries will be cancelled or postponed, they said.""During the COVID-19 pandemics elective surgeries have been cancelled to reduce the risk of patients being exposed to COVID-19 in hospital, and to support the wider hospital response, for example by converting operating theatres in to intensive care units,"" said Aneel Bhangu, from the University of Birmingham.""Although essential, cancellations place a heavy burden on patients and society. Patients' conditions may deteriorate, worsening their quality of life as they wait for rescheduled surgery. In some cases, for example cancer, delayed surgeries may lead to a number of unnecessary deaths,"" said Bhangu.Dmitri Nepogodiev, also from the University of Birmingham noted that each additional week of disruption to hospital services results in an additional 43,300 surgeries being cancelled.Therefore, it is important that hospitals regularly assess the situation so that elective surgery can be resumed at the earliest opportunity, he said."
4e68773e197ffddf910e76e8a65212cf,"FileAs the coronavirus crisis continues to deepen, various vaccines and potential medicines are being claimed as possible cures for the deadly infection. Another such study has claimed that a head lice drug might prove effective in killing coronavirus within just 48 hours. A study led by Monash University in Melbourne, Australia claimed that a single dose of the drug Ivermectin could stop the virus from growing in cell structure. ""We found that even a single dose could essentially remove all viral RNA (effectively removed all genetic material of the virus) by 48 hours and that even at 24 hours there was a really significant reduction in it,"" Dr. Kylie Wagstaff from Monash Biomedicine Discovery institute was quoted as saying by The Sun. ""In times when we're having a global pandemic and there isn't an approved treatment, if we had a compound that was already available around the world then that might help people sooner. Realistically it's going to be a while before a vaccine is broadly available,"" Dr. Wagstaff said. However, it is pertinent to mention that there is no proof of it being a cure for the coronavirus. Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos urged people to not misuse the substance. India TV also urges readers to completely avoid self-medication as it may have fatal consequences. ""There is no reason to be buying lice treatment unless you're going to be using it on your children's hair,"" Ms Mikakos said during a press conference updating Victorians on the coronavirus pandemic.""I just want to stress that because we've heard about people overseas who have heard about potential developments and then have ingested drugs that have been used in a completely inappropriate way and have died as a result.""I don't want to see people rushing out to their pharmacies or their supermarkets buying lice treatments now because scientists are doing this work."

In another regulation following his action to impose a state of emergency which followed an order to impose a nationwide curfew, Rajapaksa said no one should come out and visit public places during the curfew hours.“I consider that it is necessary to maintain public order in the areas….direct that no person shall be on any public road, railway, public park, public recreation ground or other public ground or the seashore in such areas from 1800 hour of April 2, 2022, to 0600 hours of April 4, 2022, except under the authority of a written permit granted,” he said.However, even after the curfew came into force at 6 pm on Saturday, peaceful protests continued well into the night. People were seen protesting in several Colombo suburbs despite the curfew order. In recent weeks, there has been mounting public anger against the government over its handling of the country’s worst-ever economic crisis.People were seen standing in long queues for fuel and cooking gas, besides facing long hours of power outages. The demands for Rajapaksa’s resignation have been growing. A foreign exchange crunch in Sri Lanka has led to a shortage of essential goods such as fuel and cooking gas. Power cuts last up to 13 hours a day.Sri Lanka is currently experiencing its worst economic crisis in history. With long lines for fuel, cooking gas, essentials in short supply, and long hours of power cuts the people have been suffering for weeks. Rajapaksa has defended his government's actions, saying the foreign exchange crisis was not his making and the economic downturn was largely pandemic driven.ALSO READ | Sri Lanka declares public emergency after unrest due to economic crisis; curfew in Western ProvinceALSO READ | Sri Lanka crisis: 45 arrested after violent protest near President's residence"

dcce4c9e28e107e5d912efbfbd5db27b,"The second debate of the Democratic primary has higher stakes for a historically large field of more than 20 candidatesDemocrats gathering in Detroit for a pivotal presidential debate will have to decide, once again, how to respond to President Donald Trump while presenting their own vision for the country.Candidates are sure to use the high-profile setting on Tuesday and Wednesday to blast Trump’s recent string of racist and incendiary tweets and comments, first about four congresswomen and more recently about Baltimore, a racially diverse U.S. city that, like Detroit, has faced challenges. But they’ll also be under pressure to provide specifics about how they would improve the lives of Americans by lowering the cost of health care or protecting jobs at a time when the economy is showing signs of sputtering.The second debate of the Democratic primary has higher stakes for a historically large field of more than 20 candidates, 10 of whom will face off each night. For several candidates, the debates will likely offer a last chance to be considered a serious contender for the party’s nomination. Tougher rules set by the Democratic National Committee are expected to winnow the race. To qualify for the next debates in September, candidates must raise money from more donors and hit higher polling thresholds — a bar more than half of the candidates are at risk of missing.Who's in, who's out: Meet the Democrats running for presidentHealth care and jobs are expected to be major topics as 20 Democratic presidential hopefuls prepare the second round of Democratic presidential debates in Detroit. AP Political reporter Hunter Woodall breaks down what to look for. “Everything’s at stake,” said Jill Alper, a Democratic strategist who has worked on seven presidential campaigns. She had simple and direct advice for the White House hopefuls confronting questions about Trump: “protest and pivot” — and “pivot quickly” — to what they can offer American families.The two leading progressives in the field, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, will be at center stage on Tuesday. Warren’s campaign has gained ground in recent weeks, partially at the expense of Sanders. The debate could offer a high-profile chance for Warren to prove to Sanders’ supporters that she’s worthy of their consideration.The night will also provide a contrast with more moderate candidates, such as South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, poised to offer themselves as alternatives to the liberals.Also on stage will be former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who has repeatedly said Sanders’ brand of democratic socialism is bad for the party and the country, as well as Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, author Marianne Williamson and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who joined the race after the other candidates and did not qualify for last month’s debate in Miami.Wednesday will provide a rematch between former Vice President Joe Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who went after Biden during the June debate for not supporting federal busing orders as a means of desegregation when he was in the U.S. Senate in the 1970s, prefacing her comments by saying, “I do not believe you are a racist.”Biden defended his record but appeared caught off guard by the exchange, a shaky response that could give voters pause about his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump on a debate stage or otherwise in a general election, said Michigan-based pollster Bernie Porn.“Biden needs to do better,” he said.Several candidates have been putting out policy proposals ahead of the debate, likely as a way to get out in front of rivals’ criticism.Harris, who says she supports Sanders’ plan for “Medicare for All,” released a proposal Monday that stopped short of the proposal he and other more liberal candidates are backing. She said she envisions a role for private insurers —Sanders’ plan does not — and she would slow the transition to 10 years rather than four.While Sanders won’t be on stage with Harris, other advocates of the plan will be, and could take her to task for not going far enough. Biden’s campaign, meanwhile, attacked from another direction, saying that she has been inconsistent and that her plan would undo the Affordable Care Act approved under President Barack Obama and force a large tax increase on middle-class families.Warren on Monday rolled out a trade policy that would propose nine preconditions for U.S. trading partners to meet to participate in agreements, including an end to fossil-fuel subsidies. She did not rule out tariffs, echoing some of the rhetoric Trump used in 2016 as he wooed working-class voters in places like Michigan.Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons said the intramural fight among Democrats is necessary to get a battle-tested nominee who is ready to face Trump on all topics, including race. But he said it’s important for Democrats not to let the president off the hook for his racial rhetoric and policies, noting, “The Trump factor is always present.” He said Trump’s latest comments blasting Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings and his Baltimore-area district underscore voters’ unease with Trump in the White House.“People argue over whether we are beating up the ultimate nominee, but if we don’t, Trump will,” Simmons said. “People are testing each other. How you stand up under pressure is part of what the judgment is of who’s the best candidate.”The Trump campaign and Michigan Republicans also were readying for the 2020 election, meeting in Lansing for what they said was part of a nationwide effort to train thousands of volunteers. Michigan GOP Chairwoman Laura Cox said they were starting earlier than in past election cycles.Also Read | China going to make trade deal with United States: Donald Trump"

Photographs of women and children being beaten and whipped by the Taliban fighters have surfaced showing the brutal face of the insurgents. Reports of civilians - women and children - being beaten, houses being ransacked have been pouring in since August 15 - the day the Taliban seized control of capital Kabul.According to reports, the US troops who have taken over the control of the Hamid Karzai International airport in Kabul on Wednesday night opened controlled firing to disperse the crowd. However, Taliban fighters resorted to indiscriminate firing outside the Northern Gate at the airport, leading to chaos. Reports say that women and children were beaten as they passed through checkpoints set up by Taliban fighters to reach the airport to flee the country.Reports say that Taliban fighters are checking the documents and forcibly turning some people around at the checkpoints, refusing to let them reach the airport. At least 40 people have lost their lives in violence at Kabul airport so far.The US and other countries have resumed their flights to evacuate their citizens. Commercial flights are still not operating.Reports said people of various ages, both women and men, some without passports, are seeking to board aircraft and evacuate the country. Large numbers of women are attempting to flee, saying the desperate situation in the country is compelling them to go.Earlier this week, disturbing visuals emerged from Kabul airport showing people clinging to planes to escape the country. Two people even fell from the undercarriage of the plane while the flight took off from the airport.Taliban entered Kabul on Sunday and took control of the presidential palace. Soon after the terror group claimed control over the Afghan capital, several countries started evacuating their diplomatic personnel and people from the country. President Ashraf Ghani fled the country, bringing a stunning end to a two-decade campaign in which the US and its allies had tried to transform the country. The fall of Kabul marked the final chapter of America’s longest war, which began after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. A US-led invasion dislodged the Taliban and beat them back, but America lost focus on the conflict in the chaos of the Iraq war. For years, the US sought an exit from Afghanistan. Then-President Donald Trump signed a deal with the Taliban in February 2020 that limited direct military action against the insurgents. That allowed the fighters to gather strength and move quickly to seize key areas when President Joe Biden announced his plans to withdraw all American forces by the end of this month.READ MORE: Ashraf Ghani posts first video message after leaving Afghanistan: 'In talks to return home'READ MORE: India ‘very carefully’ following developments in Afghanistan: S Jaishankar   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_9590784668 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_qkqx479w/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_qkqx479w_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Muqabla: Will Taliban drive the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections narrative?"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""2271"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_9590784668 = ''; jwsetup_9590784668(); function jwsetup_9590784668() { jwvidplayer_9590784668 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_9590784668"").setup(jwconfig_9590784668); jwvidplayer_9590784668.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_9590784668, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_qkqx479w\"", ns_st_pr=\""Muqabla: Will Taliban drive the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections narrative?\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Muqabla: Will Taliban drive the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections narrative?\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Muqabla: Will Taliban drive the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections narrative?\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-08-18\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-08-18\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/08/0_qkqx479w/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_9590784668.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_9590784668.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_9590784668.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_9590784668.stop(); jwvidplayer_9590784668.remove(); jwvidplayer_9590784668 = ''; jwsetup_9590784668(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_9590784668.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_9590784668.stop(); jwvidplayer_9590784668.remove(); jwvidplayer_9590784668 = ''; jwsetup_9590784668(); return; }); jwvidplayer_9590784668.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9590784668.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9590784668.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9590784668.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9590784668.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9590784668.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }   "
1fe754d7093293eabb89badfa84eddd1,"Pakistan defends Chinese investment after US criticises CPEC projectPakistan on Thursday rejected US criticism of the USD 60 billion CPEC under China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), saying the project has helped the cash-strapped country to ""fill the gaps"" in energy, infrastructure, industrialization and job creation.Senior US diplomat Alice Wells has said there is no transparency in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the firms blacklisted by the World Bank have got contracts under the project, which will increase the country's debt burden.Wells, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia who is on a four-day visit to Pakistan, made the remarks while speaking at a think tank event on Tuesday.The Chinese embassy here also rejected her remarks as a ""negative propaganda"" against the CPEC. ""Although you can never wake up a person who is pretending to be asleep, we have to make our position clear and reject the negative propaganda by the US,"" the embassy's spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday.At the weekly media briefing on Thursday, Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said China has helped Pakistan to ""fill the gaps in energy, infrastructure, industrialisation and job creation"".""CPEC was not being financed only through loans or non-concessional financing with sovereign guarantees. The CPEC debt amounts to USD 4.9 billion which is not even 10 per cent of the country's total debt,"" she said.The CPEC is a planned network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China's resource-rich Xinjiang province with Pakistan's strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea.The project was launched in 2015 when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Pakistan and it now envisages investment of over USD 60 billion in different projects of development in Pakistan.Highlighting the achievements under the CPEC, Farooqui said 7,000 MW power projects worth USD 12.4 billion have reached completion stage. Responding to a question on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the spokesperson said Pakistan has taken a whole range of steps to meet the requirements of the FATF. ""We remain closely engaged with the FATF members, including the US,"" she said.The FATF in October decided to keep Pakistan on its 'Grey' list for failure to curb funnelling of funds to terror groups LeT, JeM and others. If not removed off the list by April, Pakistan may move to a blacklist of countries that face severe economic sanctions, such as Iran.Pakistan has submitted a 650-page review report to the FATF on January 8. The report was submitted in response to 150 questions raised by the FATF regarding new Pakistani policies on money laundering. The report outlined the steps taken by Pakistan between October 2019 to January 2020 to implement the group's recommendations.Farooqui also welcomed Donald Trump's offer of mediation on the Kashmir issue and hoped that the desire of the US President would be translated into some kind of action.During a meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Trump said the US is watching the developments between India and Pakistan over Kashmir ""very closely"" and repeated his offer to ""help"" resolve the longstanding dispute between the two neighbours.Trump has repeatedly offered to mediate following India's August 5 decision to revoke the special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcate the state into two Union Territories, evoking strong reactions from Pakistan which has been trying to internationalise the issue.New Delhi has defended its move, saying Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and the issue was strictly internal to the country, and the special status provisions only gave rise to terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.Although President Trump has offered to mediate on the Kashmir issue in the past, New Delhi has told Washington that it is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan and there is no scope for any third-party mediation.To a question on India getting S-400 missiles, Farooqui said Pakistan has repeatedly expressed concerns over the induction of ballistic missile defense system in the region.""Such destabilising systems can undermine regional stability and may lead to an unnecessary arms race,"" she said, adding that Pakistan has proposed discussion on a strategic restraint regime for South Asia to avoid the induction of the destabilising weapons. Russia has started production of S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile systems for India and all the five units will be delivered by 2025. "

The Chinese delegation will be led by Vice Premier Liu He.Topics of discussion will include forced technology transfer, intellectual property rights, services, non-tariff barriers, agriculture and enforcement, the White House Press Secretary said in a statement.""The two sides will look to build on the deputy-level talks of the past weeks,"" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said. China and the US have been negotiating a trade deal for more than 10 months now.President Donald Trump wants to reach an agreement with the Chinese that reduces the massive trade imbalance between the two countries, which last year climbed to over USD 539 billion.He also wants China to address the issue of theft of intellectual properties of US companies and their forced coercion inside China.The Trump administration had first imposed tariffs on Chinese imports last year in a bid to win concessions from China, which responded with tit-for-tat tariffs. The escalating dispute between the world's two largest economies has depressed stock prices and poses a threat to the global economy.Both sides have made conciliatory gestures ahead of the next round of talks, but a deal remains elusive.The US postponed a further tariff hike on Chinese goods, and China lifted punitive duties on soybeans. The move helps both American farmers and Chinese pig breeders, who use soy as feed and are struggling with a devastating outbreak of African swine fever."
68addd70c2daaa7a79fafc163752ccc0,"Aeroflot's passengers planes are parked at Sheremetyevo airport, outside Moscow, Russia.Aeroflot, Russia’s flagship carrier, has announced that it will halt all international flights except to Belarus starting March 8.The move by Russia’s biggest state-owned airline comes after the country’s aviation agency, Rosaviatsiya, who recommended that all Russian airlines with foreign-leased planes halt both passenger and cargo flights abroad.It cited a high risk of foreign-leased planes being impounded as part of Western sanctions that ban leasing of planes to Russia.Rosaviatsiya’s recommendation doesn’t apply to Russian airlines that use Russian planes or foreign planes that aren't at risk of being impounded.It also doesn’t apply to foreign airlines from countries that have not imposed sanctions on Russia and have not shut down their airspace for Russian planes. Aeroflot's statement Saturday cited “circumstances that hinder operating flights” as a reason for its move.Aeroflot said it would cancel return tickets for passengers who are scheduled to depart Russia after March 6 and travel back after March 8. Those with one-way tickets will be allowed to fly up until March 8. Earlier this week, S7, Russia’s biggest private airline, announced that it was halting all international flights starting Saturday.ALSO READ: Russia-Ukraine War: Govt's efforts in rescuing Indians deserve praise, not PR exercise, says Tharoor "
5796b448a81a0883ea7c1b3283736e21,"White House press secretary reveals Trump's bank detailsRevealing a little too much, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany committed a gaffe by disclosing President Donald Trump's bank information while displaying a cheque donating his quarterly salary to the Department of Health and Human Services.As McEnany held the cheque to show it to the reporters on Friday, it not only had the USD 100,000 amount to be given to the HHS but also displayed the president's private bank account and routing numbers, The New York Times reported.The donation was as per the quarterly tradition of Trump to forgo his USD 400,000 salary and donate it.In the past, Trump has donated to the Small Business Administration initiative to help veteran entrepreneurs, to the Office of the Surgeon General to fight the opioid epidemic, and to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, among other places.According to the nbcnews.com, the donation to HHS is being made to develop new therapies for treating and preventing coronavirus.""Here is the cheque,"" McEnany said as she held the cheque, which appeared to be a real Capital One bearing not just the president's name and signature, but also his bank information.The address of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and other personal details, like accounting and routing numbers, were also visible on the cheque, the nbcnews.com report said.The New York Times report quoted an administration official as saying that mock checks were never used in the briefing.Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said that Trump's salary went to help advance new therapies to treat this virus, ""but leave it to the media to find a shameful reason not to simply report the facts, focusing instead on whether the cheque is real or not.”However, there were concerns over the revelation of the president's bank details in the media.“It's not a best practice to share that information publicly,” Eva Velasquez, the president and chief executive of the Identity Theft Resource Center, was quoted as saying in the report.“If you don't have protections in place, there are sophisticated schemes and ways someone could access those funds knowing the account and routing number and the individual person it belongs to,” she said. "

This is my first meeting with you since I became the Prime Minister,"" Rajapaksa said.""Even though we are not meeting face to face our historical friendship would continue to grow"", he said, adding that as the leader of the SAARC, India has taken the lead in fostering regional cooperation.""Prime Minister @narendramodi and I held a very successful Virtual Summit today to exchange views on the #SriLanka – #India bilateral cooperation. We both agreed to continue the two-way dialogue to further advance the centuries-old, robust relationship between our two countries,"" Rajapaksa said in a tweet.The Sri Lankan prime minister told his Indian counterpart that his party had received a large electoral mandate at two successive elections.""We are happy with the large mandate we received and I wish to assure you that we will make use of the mandate and create conditions for all communities to live in coexistence,"" he said.On regional security, he told Modi that Sri Lanka was aware of India's ready cooperation and understanding of issues concerning security and international borders. ""You are supportive of our efforts to find solutions to these issues while emphasising the need to work in close cooperation,” he said.Rajapaksa recalled that India had assisted Sri Lanka in combating COVID-19 as the island nation had received praise from the WHO for curbing the pandemic.Rajapaksa said the economies of both countries were presented with opportunities in the post-COVID-19 phase as Sri Lanka was bent on concentrating on an economy based on local production.He recalled the joint Indo-Lanka effort in handling the oil tanker fire off Sri Lanka’s east coast and said he was thankful to India for its assistance.The summit was the result of Modi’s initiative during his telephone conversation with Rajapaksa after the ruling SLPP recorded a landslide win in the August parliamentary election."
b9e24f835ce9738b3ddb11af629d30ca,"Muslim women ride a motorbike past a coronavirus-themed mural in Jakarta, Indonesia, Thursday, Sept. 10, 2020In October, Indonesian diplomats and Muslim clerics stepped off a plane in China. While the diplomats were there to finalize deals to ensure millions of doses reached Indonesian citizens, the clerics had a much different concern: Whether the COVID-19 vaccine was permissible for use under Islamic law.As companies race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and countries scramble to secure doses, questions about the use of pork products — banned by some religious groups — have raised concerns about the possibility of disrupted immunization campaigns.Pork-derived gelatin has been widely used as a stabilizer to ensure vaccines remain safe and effective during storage and transport. Some companies have worked for years to develop pork-free vaccines: Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis has produced a pork-free meningitis vaccine, while Saudi- and Malaysia-based AJ Pharma is currently working on one of their own.But demand, existing supply chains, cost and the shorter shelf life of vaccines not containing porcine gelatin means the ingredient is likely to continue to be used in a majority of vaccines for years, said Dr. Salman Waqar, general secretary of the British Islamic Medical Association.Spokespeople for Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have said that pork products are not part of their COVID-19 vaccines. But limited supply and preexisting deals worth millions of dollars with other companies mean that some countries with large Muslim populations, such as Indonesia, will receive vaccines that have not yet been certified to be gelatin-free.This presents a dilemma for religious communities, including Orthodox Jews and Muslims, where the consumption of pork products is deemed religiously unclean, and how the ban is applied to medicine, he said.“There’s a difference of opinion amongst Islamic scholars as to whether you take something like pork gelatin and make it undergo a rigorous chemical transformation,” Waqar said. “Is that still considered to be religiously impure for you to take?”The majority consensus from past debates over pork gelatin use in vaccines is that it is permissible under Islamic law, as “greater harm” would occur if the vaccines weren’t used, said Dr. Harunor Rashid, an associate professor at the University of Sydney.There’s a similar assessment by a broad consensus of religious leaders in the Orthodox Jewish community as well.“According to the Jewish law, the prohibition on eating pork or using pork is only forbidden when it’s a natural way of eating it,” said Rabbi David Stav, chairman of Tzohar, a rabbinical organization in Israel.If “it’s injected into the body, not (eaten) through the mouth,” then there is “no prohibition and no problem, especially when we are concerned about sicknesses,” he said.Yet there have been dissenting opinions on the issue — some with serious health consequences for Indonesia, which has the world’s largest Muslim population, some 225 million.In 2018, the Indonesian Ulema Council, the Muslim clerical body that issues certifications that a product is halal, or permissible under Islamic law, decreed that the measles and rubella vaccines were “haram,” or unlawful, because of the gelatin. Religious and community leaders began to urge parents to not allow their children to be vaccinated.“Measles cases subsequently spiked, giving Indonesia the third-highest rate of measles in the world,” said Rachel Howard, director of the health care market research group Research Partnership.A decree was later issued by the Muslim clerical body saying it was permissible to receive the vaccine, but cultural taboos still led to continued low vaccination rates, Howard said.“Our studies have found that some Muslims in Indonesia feel uncomfortable with accepting vaccinations containing these ingredients,” even when the Muslim authority issues guidelines saying they are permitted, she said.Governments have taken steps to address the issue. In Malaysia, where the halal status of vaccines has been identified as the biggest issue among Muslim parents, stricter laws have been enacted so that parents must vaccinate their children or face fines and jail time. In Pakistan, where there has been waning vaccine confidence for religious and political reasons, parents have been jailed for refusing to vaccinate their children against polio.But with rising vaccine hesitancy and misinformation spreading around the globe, including in religious communities, Rashid said community engagement is “absolutely necessary.”“It could be disastrous,” if there is not strong community engagement from governments and health care workers, he said.In Indonesia, the government has already said it will include the Muslim clerical body in the COVID-19 vaccine procurement and certification process.“Public communication regarding the halal status, price, quality and distribution must be well-prepared,” Indonesian President Joko Widodo said in October.While they were in China in the fall, the Indonesian clerics inspected China’s Sinovac Biotech facilities, and clinical trials involving some 1,620 volunteers are also underway in Indonesia for the company’s vaccine. The government has announced several COVID-19 vaccine procurement deals with the company totaling millions of doses.Sinovac Biotech, as well as Chinese companies Sinopharm and CanSino Biologics — which all have COVID-19 vaccines in late-stage clinical trials and deals selling millions of doses around the world — did not respond to Associated Press requests for ingredient information.In China, none of the COVID-19 vaccines has been granted final market approval, but more than 1 million health care workers and others who have been deemed at high risk of infection have received vaccines under emergency use permission. The companies have yet to disclose how effective the vaccines are or possible side effects.Pakistan is late-stage clinical trial of the CanSino Biologics vaccine. Bangladesh previously had an agreement with Sinovac Biotech to conduct clinical trials in the country, but the trials have been delayed due to a funding dispute. Both countries have some of the largest Muslim populations in the world.While health care workers on the ground in Indonesia are still largely engaged in efforts to contain the virus as numbers continue to surge, Waqar said government efforts to reassure Indonesians will be key to a successful immunization campaign as COVID-19 vaccines are approved for use.But, he said, companies producing the vaccines must also be part of such community outreach.“The more they are transparent, the more they are open and honest about their product, the more likely it is that there are communities that have confidence in the product and will be able to have informed discussions about what it is they want to do,” he said.“Because, ultimately, it is the choice of individuals.”"

b90073a30b63428f4d5951d667a05b49,"Police detain demonstrators during an action against Russia's attack on Ukraine in St. Petersburg, RussiaA Russian military convoy threatening Kyiv is far bigger than initially thought, with satellite images from Monday showing it occupying much of a 40-mile (64-kilometer) stretch of road north of the Ukrainian capital. Explosions and gunfire were heard in embattled cities in eastern Ukraine as Russia's invasion met unexpectedly stiff resistance.The Russian military assault on Ukraine was on its fifth day Monday.A Ukrainian delegation held talks with Russian officials at the border with Belarus, though they ended with no agreements except to keep talking. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone with Putin, urging him to halt the offensive.Meanwhile, Western sanctions triggered by the invasion sent the Russian ruble plummeting, leading ordinary Russians to line up at banks and ATMs. And Russian teams were suspended from all international soccer matches, including qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup, pushing the country toward sports pariah status.What's happening on the ground?Kyiv's outgunned but determined troops slowed Russia's advance and held onto the capital and other key cities — at least for the time being. US officials say they believe the invasion has been more difficult than the Kremlin envisioned, though that could change as Moscow adapts. Russia still lacked control of Ukrainian airspace.As talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations wrapped up near the Belarusian border, several blasts could be heard in Kyiv itself.Russian troops have been advancing slowly on the capital city of nearly 3 million people. On Monday, a military convoy consisting of hundreds of armoured vehicles, tanks, artillery and support vehicles was no more than 17 miles (25 kilometers) from the city centre, according to satellite imagery from the Maxar company.It was believed earlier Monday to be 17 miles (25 kilometres) log, but additional satellite imagery showed it stretching for 40 miles. Maxar said the newer images cover a wider area and were less obscured by clouds. Several homes and other buildings were seen burning near roads where the convoy is travelling.How are ordinary Ukrainians coping?Long lines formed outside Kyiv supermarkets Monday as residents were allowed out of bomb shelters and homes for the first time since a curfew was imposed Saturday. Some found food, but others didn't.Hundreds of thousands of civilians have sought safety at night in Kyiv's subway system and other makeshift shelters around the country, where parents try to calm their children's fears. Despite the shortages, lack of privacy and other challenges, Ukrainians were trying to put on a brave face.“It's much harder for soldiers at the front. It's embarrassing to complain about the icy floor, drafts and terrible toilets,” said 74-year-old Irina, who sought safety in a Kyiv underground station and would not give her last name. Her grandson Anton is among those fighting in eastern Ukraine.Ukrainian authorities said at least seven people were killed and dozens were injured in fighting in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, where social media videos showed apartment buildings being shelled. They warned that the actual figures could be much higher.UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said her office had confirmed that 102 civilians, including seven children, have been killed in the Russian invasion and 304 others wounded since Thursday, though she cautioned the tally was likely a vast undercount.Is there any chance for diplomacy?Ukrainian and Russian delegations met Monday on Ukraine's border with Belarus. The meeting ended with no immediate reports of agreements, but Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said further talks could take place “in the near future.”Before the meeting, Zelenskyy's office said Ukraine would demand an immediate cease-fire.While Ukraine sent its defense minister and other top officials, the Russian delegation was led by Putin's cultural adviser — Vladimir Medinsky — an unlikely envoy for ending the war and a sign of how Moscow viewed the talks.Medinsky said the sides “found certain points on which common positions could be foreseen.” He also said the talks would continue in the coming days on the Polish-Belarusian border.Western officials believe Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine's government and replace it with a compliant regime, reviving Moscow's Cold War-era influence. His comments have raised fears that the invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear war, whether by design or mistake.On Monday afternoon, Macron spoke by phone with Putin for 90 minutes, according to the French presidency.It said Putin expressed his “will to commit” to stopping all strikes against civilians and residential areas and to preserving civilian facilities. Macron asked him to end the military offensive in Ukraine and reaffirmed the need for an “immediate cease-fire.”Does Ukraine want to join the European Union?In a move sure to antagonise the Kremlin, Zelenskyy signed an application Monday asking that Ukraine be allowed to join the 27-nation European Union.He posted photos online of himself signing the application, and his office said the paperwork was on its way to Brussels, where the EU is headquartered. The move was largely symbolic, as Ukraine is very far from reaching the EU's membership standards, and the bloc is expansion-weary and unlikely to take on new members anytime soon.What's going on with the United Nations?The UN's two major bodies — the 193-nation General Assembly and the more powerful 15-member Security Council — were holding separate meetings Monday to discuss the war.The council meeting opened with the news that the United States was kicking out 12 Russian UN diplomats whom Washington accuses of spying.Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor said he plans to open an investigation “as rapidly as possible” into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.Prosecutor Karim Khan said the investigation will look at alleged crimes committed before the Russian invasion, but that he also intends to look into any new crimes that either side might have committed since the invasion started.How many have fled Ukraine?UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, speaking by video to the UN Security Council, said more than 520,000 refugees had fled Ukraine and that the number “has been rising exponentially, hour after hour.”The UN expects the total to reach 4 million in the coming weeks, he said.Earlier Monday, when the overall count still stood at around half a million, UNHCR spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo said the count included 281,000 in Poland, more than 84,500 in Hungary, about 36,400 in Moldova, over 32,500 in Romania and about 30,000 in Slovakia. The rest were scattered in other countries, she said.What about the economic fallout of the invasion?The Russian currency plunged about 30% against the US dollar on Monday after Western nations moved to block some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system and to restrict Russia's use of its massive foreign currency reserves.The ruble later recovered ground after swift action by Russia's central bank. The Moscow stock exchange was closed all day.The US Treasury Department announced new sanctions targeting the Russian central bank and state investment funds.It said the move effectively immobilizes any assets of Russia's central bank in the United States or held by Americans.The EU on Monday officially slapped sanctions on 26 more Russians, including oligarchs, senior officials and an energy insurance company, bringing the total of people targeted to 680. EU sanctions also target 53 Russian entities, which are usually organisations, agencies, banks or companies.The president of neutral Switzerland said his country would adopt the EU's sanctions targeting Russians, including asset freezes, all but depriving well-heeled Russians of access to one of their favourite safe havens to park money.In Russia, people have been flocking to banks and ATMs for days, seeking to exchange rubles for dollars or euros, with reports on social media of long lines and machines running out.Economists and analysts said a sharp devaluation of the ruble would mean a drop in the standard of living for the average Russian.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the new sanctions as “heavy,” but argued Monday that “Russia has the necessary potential to compensate the damage.” Also Read | India reiterates call for immediate cessation of violence, end to hostilities"

Well, gold price today is Rs 38,465 per 10g in the national capital. But, do you have an idea of gold rates in the neighbouring country Pakistan? Recently, Pakistan has opposed the Indian government's abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, which has affected Pakistan's economy. According to a report, Imran Khan-led Pakistani government is already facing a huge economic crisis. Due to acute debt-crisis, fuel prices have already touched the sky in Pakistan, while the gold price has jumped twice what it costs in India.However, days after PM Modi-led govt revoked Article 370--special status to Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan posed impediments in its trade and commercial relations with India, resulting gold prices soaring to new highs in the country.According to reports, the gold prices in Pakistan on August 9 surged to Rs 1,750 per 10 gms. As per Pakistan media reports, Gold per tola was sold for around Rs 87,000 in the country on Saturday and price for per 10 grams gold was Rs 74,588. Below is the table providing latest gold rates for several cities of Pakistan for 22 carat, 24 carat, 21 carat and 18 carat (dated 12 Aug, 2019 as per UrduPoint).India on August 5, revoked Article 370 of the Constitution to withdraw the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.Soon after, Pakistan suspended the Samjhauta Express train and Thar Express train service with India.

The British soldiers had launched guns which were rumored to use pig fat cartridges and had to be bitten off. Pigs were considered to be unclean by Muslims. In the video, a man, purportedly a member of the Azov fighters is seen to be dipping bullets into what appears to be pig fat as he addresses the Chechen fighters.He seems to say, “Dear Muslim brothers. In our country, you will not go to heaven. You will not be allowed into heaven. Go home, please. Here, you will encounter trouble. Thank you for your attention, goodbye.”The Azov fighters are a far-right harbouring infantry unit of the Ukrainian military. They are accused of harbouring neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology. They first fought alongside the Ukrainian army in the east of the country in 2014 against pro-Russia separatists and have since been incorporated into the regular armed forces.Although the Azov fighters have been a part of the military, they are reported to wear the Wolfsangel insignia that was used by a number of Nazi divisions during WWII.Russian President Vladimir Putin had stated the presence of such units in the Ukrainian army was one of the reasons for launching the special military operation against Ukraine.ALSO READ | Russia Ukraine War: PM Modi calls another high-level meeting ALSO READ | Russia Ukraine War: Mriya, world's largest aircraft, destroyed by Russia"

More than 3.8 million laid-off workers applied for unemployment benefits last week as the U.S. economy slid further into a crisis that is becoming the most devastating since the 1930s. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)Bleak new figures Thursday underscored the worldwide economic pain inflicted by the coronavirus: The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits has climbed past a staggering 30 million, while Europe’s economies have gone into an epic slide.And as bad as the numbers are, some are already outdated because of the lag in gathering data. The true economic picture is almost certainly much worse.The statistics are likely to stoke the debate over whether to ease the lockdowns that have closed factories and other businesses. While many states and countries have pressed ahead, health officials have warned of the danger of a second wave of infection, and some employers and employees have expressed fear of going back to work when large numbers of people are still dying.In the U.S., the government reported that 3.8 million laid-off workers applied for jobless benefits last week, raising the total to 30.3 million in the six weeks since the outbreak took hold. The layoffs amount to 1 in 6 American workers and encompass more people than the entire population of Texas.Some economists say that when the U.S. unemployment rate for April comes out next week, it could be as high as 20% — a figure not seen since the Depression of the 1930s, when joblessness peaked at 25%.The number of Americans thrown out of work could be much higher than the unemployment claims show, because some people have not applied and others couldn’t get through to their states’ overwhelmed systems. A poll by two economists found that the U.S. may have lost 34 million jobs.There was grim new data across Europe, too, where more than 130,000 people with the virus have died. The economy in the 19 countries using the euro shrank 3.8% in the first quarter of the year, the biggest contraction since the eurozone countries began keeping joint statistics 25 years ago. “This is the saddest day for the global economy we have ever seen” in the 50 years that economists at High Frequency Economics have been following the data, they wrote in a report.Even then, the statistics do not capture the enormity of the crisis. The quarterly figures cover January through March, and many of the lockdowns in Europe and the U.S. were not imposed until March — the second half of March in a multitude of places in the United States.Stocks fell on Wall Street as the discouraging news piled up, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing nearly 290 points, or more than 1 percent. Even Amazon, which Americans are relying on heavily to stock up on goods, offered a mixed report, with sales skyrocketing in the first quarter but profits dropping 29% because of the rising costs to get all those packages shipped.The company still ended the quarter on a relatively high note, however, reporting net earnings of $2.5 billion — an astonishing contrast to the losses sustained by some companies. One of them, American Airlines, slammed by a lack of passengers during the outbreak, on Thursday reported a loss of $2.2 billion for the period.The virus has killed over 230,000 people worldwide, including more than 61,000 in the U.S., according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Confirmed infections globally topped 3.2 million, with 1 million of them in the U.S., but the true numbers are believed to be much higher because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.This week, the U.S. estimated its economy shrank at a 4.8% annual rate in the first three months of the year, the sharpest quarterly drop since the 2008 financial crisis. The current quarter is expected to be much worse, with a staggering 40% drop projected.Still, analysts saw a glimmer of hope in the way new unemployment claims have fallen for four straight weeks. Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, said the wave of layoffs at vulnerable businesses such as restaurants, hotels and stores may have largely run its course.“Thankfully, for now, the economic contagion seems to have plateaued,” Stettner said. “But we’re still at a level that is a mortal threat to the nation’s financial well-being.”Across the U.S., many governors have taken steps to gradually reopen their economies, amid impatience among Americans who complain their livelihoods are being destroyed and their rights trampled.In Michigan, hundreds of protesters returned to the Capitol to denounce Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-home order and business restrictions. The Republican-led Michigan House refused to extend the state’s coronavirus emergency declaration and voted to authorize a lawsuit challenging Whitmer’s authority and actions to combat the pandemic.But even in states where businesses are being allowed to reopen, some workers are uneasy about returning.Lacey Ward, an Omaha hairstylist, said she is worried that the Nebraska governor’s decision to let salons reopen on May 4 could put her and her family at risk. She would prefer to collect unemployment until the danger subsides.“I feel like we are literally the guinea pigs in this situation,” she said.Finding enough workers willing to return is proving to be a challenge for Jennifer Holliday, manager at a restaurant in Oklahoma City that will reopen its dining room Friday. Many of her employees are not returning calls or messages.“There are some who want to just ride it out and take the unemployment,” she said."

Maldivians see India's role positively: in '88 they came, resolved the crisis, and left. They were not occupiers but liberators.

India to send envoy, backed by its military, to release judges and political detainees including President Gayoom. We request a physical presence. 2. The US to stop all financial transactions of Maldives regime leaders going through US banks,"" he had tweeted on Tuesday. India had in a strong statement said that it is ""disturbed"" by the situation in the Maldives where the Supreme Court Chief Justice and another senior judge has been jailed and emergency clamped. Yameen clamped emergency days after the apex court in a ruling last Thursday ordered the release of nine political prisoners, including Nasheed, and the reinstatement of 12 legislators who were unseated for defecting from the ruling party and annulled the apex court's previous ban on floor-crossing.In more tweets on Wednesday, Nasheed said: ""President Gayoom and the Judges must be released immediately. I am told President Gayoom is not taking food, while (jailed Supreme Court) Justice Ali Hameed has been ill treated.""He said ""Hon Qasim's son, Ibrahim, has been arrested. This is clearly politically motivated.

Punta Ventana is a famed tourist attraction, which sees thousands of tourists. The earthquake was one of the strongest ones to hit theUS territory over the past week. The number of casualties in the quake could not be ascertained. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the first quake struck at 6:32 am (1032 GMT) just south of the island at a relatively shallow depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). Later the region saw a string of smaller temblors, including one measured at magnitude 5 that struck at 10:51 am (1451 GMT), shaking power lines and frightening residents of southern Puerto Rico who had been waiting outside their homes due to fears the buildings were damaged and unstable.Image Source : AP""Punta Ventana,"" or Window Point, in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico.

Previous quakes of lesser magnitudes in recent days have cracked homes and knocked goods off supermarket shelves.Victor Huerfano, director of Puerto Rico’s Seismic Network, told the AP that shallow quakes were occurring along three faults in Puerto Rico’s southwest region: Lajas Valley, Montalva Point, and the Guayanilla Canyon. He said the quakes overall come as the North American plate and the Caribbean plate squeeze Puerto Rico, and that more earthquakes and aftershocks are expected, although officials expect them to eventually taper off.One of the largest and most damaging earthquakes to hit Puerto Rico occurred in October 1918, when a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near the island’s northwest coast, unleashing a tsunami and killing 116 people.(With inputs from Associated Press)ALSO READ | Earthquake of 5.9 magnitude hits Japan, no tsunami warning yetALSO READ | Mild earthquake hits Nepal's tourist hub Pokhara"

In North Carolina, he won 49.83 per cent of the votes, while in Ohio and Wisconsin he garnered 51.69 per cent and 47.22 per cent, repectively.All three rallies were held on Saturday, the first in Lumberton, North Carolina, followed by the second and third in Circleville, Ohio, and Waukesha, Wisconsin.Some of the topics that took centre stage in all the three events were the Covid-19 pandemic, economy, law enforcement and continued attacks against his Democratic rival Joe Biden.In Lumberton, Trump mocked the former Vice President's simultaneous drive-in rally in Pennsylvania as ""small"" compared to his.Regarding the pandemic, the President claimed that the reason why there were so many cases was because more tests were being administered on a daily basis.""Turn on television: ‘covid, covid, covid, covid, covid'. A plane goes down, 500 people dead, they don't talk about it — ‘covid, covid, covid, covid.""By the way, on November 4th, you won't hear about it anymore,"" The Hill news website quoted Trump as saying.In the second rally in Circleville, Trump touted the return of the 2020 Big Ten college football league in Ohio after it was postponed due to Covid-19.In the last rally of the day, the President pushed for states to reopen, while saying that the upcoming election was between ""a Trump boom and a Biden lockdown"".The three rallies came as a final push for the President ahead of Election Day.A Quinnipiac University poll national released on October 23 showed Biden with a 10-point advantage, and a RealClearPolitics polling average revealed that the former Vice President was leading by 8.1 percentage points.This coming week, Trump will stage more rallies in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska."

China also claimed that India was ""misleading the public"" by saying that Chinese troops are building a road close to the Chicken's Neck in the Sikkim sector which could endanger India's access to its north-eastern states. ""I want to point that the relevant actions by the Indian side violated the purposes and principles of the UN Charter in defiance of the international law and international norms. As we all know in 1950s China, India and Myanmar proposed the five principles (Panchsheel) of co-existence,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Gen Shuang told reporters here. ""However to the surprise of everyone, the Indian side trampled on the basic norms governing the international relations proposed by itself by illegally crossing into other country's territory,"" he said. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, known as the Panchsheel, are a series of principles which have formed the bedrock of the relationship between India and China. Their first formal codification in treaty form was in an agreement between China and India in 1954. The five principles of the agreement are - Mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and cooperation for mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence.Geng said this time the Indian troops crossed the delineated boundary into the Chinese side and nature of the incident was ""very serious"". ""China and India have been in contact through the special representatives mechanism to solve the boundary question but this incident, I believe, violates the spirit upheld by the Special Representatives mechanism and goes in contrast to the efforts made by the two countries,"" he said. China has already lodged a protest with India on this, Geng said. ""Indian border troops are still staying on the Chinese territory,"" he said. The situation is yet to be resolved and ""India should pull back the troops that is precondition to avoid worsening of the situation"", Geng said. ""Troops should be pulled back as soon as possible to demonstrate the sincerity to improve bilateral ties so as create conditions for the normal development of bilateral relations,"" he said. ""If the Indian side refuses to correct its mistakes in a timely fashion, how it proposes to win the trust of its neighbours and how it is supposed to play a bigger role in the international affairs,"" he said. ""We once again urge the Indian side to abide by the boundary convention and respect the Chinese sovereignty and immediately withdraw the border troops and properly deal with the incident in a timely fashion,"" Geng said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson claimed that the incident has nothing to do with the tri-junction between China, India and Bhutan. He claimed that there is no dispute with Bhutan in the Doklam area as both the countries have a ""basic consensus"" on the boundary. ""I can say that we have been stressing that Doklam belongs to China since ancient times. It was under the effective jurisdiction of China without any dispute. China and Bhutan had about 24 rounds of boundary talks,"" Shuang told a media briefing answering a question about Bhutan's protest. The standoff between troops of India and China at Doklam area started after Bhutan, which has close diplomatic and military ties with India, protested to Beijing about the People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops building a road in the strategic location close to chicken neck tri-junction.""In disregard of the 1890 Sino-Britain convention, the Indian side said that Doklam is located within the tri-junction of the three countries, that is misleading the public,"" he said. ""The 1890 convention said that the Sikkim section of the boundary commences from East mountain and the incident (of road building) took place about 2,000 meters away from Mount Gipmochi,"" Geng asserted. The Indian side is actually misleading the public by saying that the incident took place at the tri-junction point, Geng said, defending China's road building which India and Bhutan have objected to. India has expressed concern over the road building, apprehending that it may allow Chinese troops to cut India's access to its northeastern states. Geng also said that besides former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru endorsing the 1890 Sino-British convention on Sikkim in a letter to his Chinese counterpart Zhou Enlai in 1959, the Indian Embassy in a note to the Chinese government in February, 1960, also endorsed it. ""The note said that the boundary between Sikkim and China's Tibet has already been delineated and there is no dispute about that in the map and in practice,"" he said. Quoting the note, Geng said, ""The Indian government would like to add one more thing that the boundary has already been demarcated as well on the ground."" ""The above mentioned was written in black and white in the note from India,"" Geng said. Asked about Nehru, in his letter to Zhou, pointing out that Chinese maps showed Bhutanese territory as part of Chin, Geng said, ""there is no such consent as you mentioned"". The former prime minister had pointed out to China that it was claiming sizable part of Bhutan's territory. ""It is not clear to us what exactly is the implication of your statement that the boundaries of Sikkim and Bhutan do not fall within the scope of the present discussion,"" Nehru wrote in the letter to Zhou. ""In fact, Chinese maps show sizable areas of Bhutan as part of Tibet,"" Nehru had said. Geng said, ""Since the illegal trespass of the border troops, both sides have expressed stern position. The fact is that the Sikkim section of the China India boundary has already been delineated."" Since India's independence, the Indian government has repeatedly affirmed the fact that the Sikkim section has been delineated by this convention, he said. Geng's remarks come a day after, in unusually blunt remarks, China's Ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui said ""the ball is in India's court"" and it was for the Indian government to decide what options could be on the table to resolve the standoff. Asked about remarks by official Chinese media and think- tanks that the conflict can lead to a ""war"" if not handled properly, the ambassador had said ,""There has been talk about this option, that option. It is up to your government policy (whether to exercise military option)."" Asked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's comments that not a bullet has been fired at the India-China boundary for two decades, Geng said, ""I want to point settlement of the boundary serves the fundamental interests of the two sides."" ""It is also a strategic target, two sides are working to achieve. We have been trying to explore ways to resolve the boundary question with in the Special Representatives mechanism and we have jointly taken measure to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas,"" Geng said. ""What is shocking is that the India border troops entered into the Chinese side of the delineated border in the Sikkim section which is serious in nature,"" he said.(With PTI inputs)"

Donald Trump  issued a proclamation to suspend issuing of H-1B visas in a move to what he called ""moving towards a merit-based immigration system.""H-1B visas are popular among Indian IT professionals, along with other foreign work visas have been temporarily suspended for the rest of the year. Trump said the step was essential to help millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the current economic crisis.Issuing the proclamation ahead of the November presidential elections, Trump has ignored the mounting opposition to the order by various business organisations, lawmakers and human rights bodies.The proclamation that comes into effect on June 24, is expected to impact a large number of Indian IT professionals and several American and Indian companies who were issued H-1B visas by the US government for the fiscal year 2021 beginning October 1.They would now have to wait at least till the end of the current year before approaching the US diplomatic missions to get stamping. It would also impact a large number of Indian IT professionals who are seeking renewal of their H-1B visas.“In the administration of our Nation's immigration system, we must remain mindful of the impact of foreign workers on the United States labour market, particularly in the current extraordinary environment of high domestic unemployment and depressed demand for labour,” said the proclamation issued by Trump.In his proclamation, Trump said that the overall unemployment rate in the United States nearly quadrupled between February and May of 2020 -- producing some of the most extreme unemployment rates ever recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.While the May rate of 13.3 per cent reflects a marked decline from April, millions of Americans remain out of work.The proclamation also extends till the end of the year his previous executive order that had banned issuing of new green cards of lawful permanent residency.Green card holders, once admitted pursuant to immigrant visas, are granted ""open-market"" employment authorisation documents, allowing them immediate eligibility to compete for almost any job, in any sector of the economy, he said.“American workers compete against foreign nationals for jobs in every sector of our economy, including against millions of aliens who enter the United States to perform temporary work. Temporary workers are often accompanied by their spouses and children, many of whom also compete against American workers,” Trump said.“Under ordinary circumstances, properly administered temporary worker programmes can provide benefits to the economy. But under the extraordinary circumstances of the economic contraction resulting from the Covid-19 outbreak, certain non-immigrant visa programmes authorising such employment pose an unusual threat to the employment of American workers,” he said.For example, Trump said, between February and April of 2020, more than 17 million United States jobs were lost in industries in which employers are seeking to fill worker positions tied to H-2B nonimmigrant visas.“During this same period, more than 20 million United States workers lost their jobs in key industries where employers are currently requesting H-1B and L workers to fill positions,” he said.“Also, the May unemployment rate for young Americans, who compete with certain J non-immigrant visa applicants, has been particularly high -- 29.9 per cent for 16-19 year olds, and 23.2 per cent for the 20-24 year old group,” he said.“The entry of additional workers through the H-1B, H-2B, J, and L non-immigrant visa programmes, therefore, presents a significant threat to employment opportunities for Americans affected by the extraordinary economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak,” Trump said.Trump observed that excess labour supply is particularly harmful to workers at the margin between employment and unemployment -- those who are typically ""last in"" during an economic expansion and ""first out"" during an economic contraction.In recent years, these workers have been disproportionately represented by historically disadvantaged groups, including African Americans and other minorities, those without a college degree, and Americans with disabilities, he said.The proclamation suspends and limits entry into the US of H-1B, H-2B and L visas and their dependents till December 31, 2020. It also includes certain categories of J visas like an intern, trainee, teacher, camp counselor, or summer work travel programme.The new rule would apply only to those who are outside the US, do not have a valid non-immigrant visa and an official travel document other than a visa to enter the country.According to the proclamation, it does not have an impact on lawful permanent residents of the United States and foreign nationals who are spouses or child of an American citizen.Foreign nationals seeking to enter the US to provide temporary labour or services essential to the food supply chain are also exempted from the latest proclamation.(With PTI inputs)"

Also, a 77-year-old man was apparently knocked down by the wind and died after going out to check on his hunting dogs, Lenoir County authorities said, and the governor’s office said a man was electrocuted while trying to connect extension cords in the rain.Related Stories Hurricane Florence weakens to Category 2, continues to be extremely dangerous Hurricane Florence’s uncertain track sows fear; 10 million in crosshairsHurricane Florence batters parts of Carolinas, forecasters predict heavy rains and floods over next weekendAs the nearly 400-mile-wide Florence pounded away at the coast with torrential downpours and surging seas, rescue crews used boats to reach more than 360 people besieged by rising waters in New Bern, while many of their neighbors awaited help.

The storm knocked out power to more than 890,000 homes and businesses, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks the U.S. electrical grid.North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper called Florence an “uninvited brute” that could wipe out entire communities as it grinds across the state.“The fact is this storm is deadly and we know we are days away from an ending,” Cooper said. Parts of North Carolina had seen storm surges — the bulge of seawater pushed ashore by the hurricane — as high as 10 feet (3 meters), he said.After reaching a terrifying Category 4 peak of 140 mph (225 kph) earlier in the week, Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane at 7:15 a.m. at Wrightsville Beach, a few miles (kilometers) east of Wilmington and not far from the South Carolina line. It came ashore along a mostly boarded-up, emptied-out stretch of coastline.By Friday evening, Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm, its winds weakened to 70 mph (112 kph) as it moved forward at 3 mph (6 kph) about 15 miles (25 kilometers) north of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Florence’s forward movement during the day slowed to a near-standstill — sometimes it was going no faster than a human can walk — and that enabled it to pile on the rain.The flooding soon spread into South Carolina, swamping places like North Myrtle Beach, in a resort area known for its white sands and multitude of golf courses.For people living inland in the Carolinas, the moment of maximum peril from flash flooding could arrive days later, because it takes time for rainwater to drain into rivers and for those streams to crest.Preparing for the worst, about 9,700 National Guard troops and civilians were deployed with high-water vehicles, helicopters and boats.National Guard members stack sand bags near the Lumber River.National Guard members stack sand bags near the Lumber River.Authorities warned, too, of the threat of mudslides and the risk of an environmental disaster from floodwaters washing over industrial waste sites and hog farms.Florence was seen as a major test for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was heavily criticized as slow and unprepared last year for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, where the death toll was put at nearly 3,000.The National Hurricane Center said Florence will eventually break up over the southern Appalachians and make a right hook to the northeast, its rainy remnants moving into the mid-Atlantic states and New England by the middle of next week.Some of the worst flooding was in New Bern, where authorities were enforcing a curfew.Both the Trent and Neuse rivers overflowed their banks, flooding homes, stores and streets and trapping many people in their houses.""WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU. You may need to move up to the second story, or to your attic, but WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU,"" the authorities in New Bern said on Twitter.Governor Cooper said there have been ""several hundred"" rescue operations and ""there are still some people they need to get to.""Besides federal and state emergency crews, rescuers were being helped by volunteers from the so-called ""Cajun Navy"" who also turned up in Houston during Hurricane Harvey to carry out water rescues.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump will travel to areas hit by Hurricane Florence next week, the White House said Friday, as the deadly storm pummels the US East Coast with torrential rains.""The president is expected to travel to areas affected by the storm early to middle of next week, once it is determined his travel will not disrupt any rescue or recovery efforts,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said."

The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.In a major policy document for Indian-Americans released on the occasion of India's 74th Independence Day on Saturday, the Biden Campaign also emphasised its support to family-based immigration system and streamlining processing for religious worker visas.The administration will also take steps to stem the rising tide of hate and bigotry, address the security needs of house of worship, eliminate language barriers and honour the diversity and contributions of Indian-Americans, it said.This is for the first time that a Democratic presidential candidate has come out with an exclusive policy document for Indian-Americans. There are 1.3 million eligible Indian-American voters across eight battleground states. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is scheduled to address the Indian-American community in a video message later in the day.Biden will support family-based immigration and preserve family unification as a core principle of our immigration system, which includes reducing the family visa backlog, his campaign said.""He will increase the number of visas offered for permanent, work-based immigration based on macroeconomic conditions and exempt from any cap recent graduates of PhD programmes in STEM fields,"" the campaign said.""And, he will support first reforming the temporary visa system for high-skill, specialty jobs to protect wages and workers, then expanding the number of visas offered and eliminating the limits on employment-based green cards by country, which have kept so many Indian families in waiting for too long,"" it said.According to the policy document, Biden will restore and defend the naturalisation process for Green Card holders. A Green Card allows a non-US citizen to live and work permanently in America.""He will increase the number of refugees we welcome into this country by setting the annual global refugee admissions target to 125,000 and seek to raise it over time to commensurate with our responsibility, our values, and the unprecedented global need,"" it said.""He will also work with Congress to establish a minimum admissions number of 95,000 refugees annually. Biden will remove the uncertainty for Dreamers by reinstating the DACA programme and explore all legal options to protect their families from inhumane separation,"" the campaign said.It said Biden will end workplace raids and protect other sensitive locations from immigration enforcement actions.As a largely immigrant community, but in some cases with American roots reaching back generations, Indian-Americans know firsthand the strength and resilience that immigrants bring to the US, the campaign said.""But President Trump has waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants. It's wrong, and it stops when Biden is president,"" it alleged.""Biden will rescind Trump's Muslim ban on day one and reverse the detrimental asylum policies that are causing chaos and a humanitarian crisis at our border,” the campaign said.""He will immediately begin working with Congress to pass legislative immigration reform that modernises our system, with a priority on keeping families together by providing a roadmap to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants — including more than 500,000 from India,” it said.Indian-Americans of all backgrounds — Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, Jain, and others — have been subjected to bullying and xenophobic attacks and need now, more than ever, a reassurance that the US leaders in Washington will have their backs, it said.During the Obama-Biden administration, the FBI expanded its hate crime statistics programme to include Sikhs, Hindus, and Buddhists. As President, Biden will directly address the rise in hateful attacks and enact legislation prohibiting someone convicted of a hate crime from purchasing or possessing a firearm, it said.""Biden will appoint leaders at the Department of Justice who will prioritise the prosecution of hate crimes, and he will order his Justice Department to focus additional resources to combat hate crimes — including religion-based hate crimes — and to confront white nationalist terrorism,"" it said.""He will also seek legislation that increases the potential sentence for certain hate crimes that occur in houses of worship and other religious community sites, such as gurudwaras, mandirs, temples, and mosques. And, he will use his executive power to ensure that the Department of Justice pursues such heinous acts of violence against houses of worship to the fullest extent of the law,"" the campaign said.Noting that in 2012, the Sikh community suffered a terrible tragedy when a white supremacist opened fire in an Oak Creek, Wisconsin, gurdwara, ultimately killing seven and wounding four, the campaign added that in January 2019, a Hindu temple was the victim of a horrific act of vandalism and destruction, with windows shattered and xenophobic messages spray-painted across the walls."

POTUS also visited the city of Agra as hundreds of artists welcomed the American leader at the airport with beautiful performances reflecting the rich culture of Uttar Pradesh. Trump was received at the Kheria airbase by Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. He arrived from Ahmedabad after jointly attending with Prime Minister Narendra Modi the mega 'Namaste Trump' event at the Motera cricket stadium.A giant billboard featuring Trump, First Lady Melania Trump and Prime Minister Modi greeted the couple with a message – 'Grand welcome of India's best friend to the City of Love –Agra'.The US President, on many occasions has made it clear that he does not like handshakes and views it as a struggle for dominance. However, with all concern with Trump's dislikes, his handshakes have not stopped, but have only increased. There have been numerous instances wherein the US President's handshakes with other world leaders have caught the limelight. Many videos have also gone viral with this respect in the past. President Trump's handshake with Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa spread rapidly around the internet after he pulled Trump forward, appearing to briefly throw him off balance. Some of Trump’s other recent handshakes have also been notable.French President Emmanuel Macron, who has an on-again, off-again relationship with Trump, had such a forceful handshake with him during a G7 meeting in May of 2017 that it left his knuckles white. Macron later called the experience a “moment of truth.”Image Source : AP April 24, 2018: Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron walk to the Oval Office at the White HouseApril 24, 2018: Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron walk to the Oval Office at the White HouseBack in July 2017, both the leaders visited Paris and locked horns again - this time for almost 30 seconds in an embrace that morphed into a three-person ordeal as Trump reached out to grasp the hands of France’s first lady while still holding onto Macron.Later in November 2017, Trump surfaced in the news again after he incorrectly initiated his portion of a complicated arm-crossing ritual. He momentarily grabbed the hand of the neighbour to his right with his right arm, instead of his left, before correcting himself with a visible grimace. Upon a first failed attempt onstage during the summit’s opening ceremony, he corrected his mistake to connect with his fellow hand-holding partners, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.Image Source : APPresident Trump reacts as he does the ASEAN-way handshakePresident Trump reacts as he does the ASEAN-way handshakePresident Trump's dislikes for handshakes have not even spared Barack Obama. The first meeting of the 44th and 45th president may have been his most normal yet. Still, despite the presence of an appropriately timed handshake, Trump failed to make eye contact with his predecessor in November 2016, instead of fixating on Obama’s tie.Image Source : APUS President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama snapped during a handshakeUS President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama snapped during a handshakeRussian President Vladimir Putin has also fallen victim to Trump’s atypical handshakes. Though their encounter during the G20 Summit in July of last year started off as a normal greeting, Trump reached up to repeatedly tap the bottom of Putin’s forearm before it was finished. Off late, at the start of the State of the Union address, it appeared Nancy Pelosi extended her hand to Trump, a gesture amid the divisive impeachment proceedings. President Trump was presenting folios to Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence as he arrived for the evening speech when it appears she reached for the shake. At the same time, Trump turned away from her to face the audience of lawmakers gathered for the annual address.Image Source : APDonald Trump avoids a handshake with Nancy PelosiDonald Trump avoids a handshake with Nancy PelosiLater, it was reported Nancy Pelosi tore Trump's speech paper after he refused to shake hands with her.

9560d1d07de4e3030e9e36ae23f6d31a,"The US military has halted some exercises with its Gulf Arab allies over the ongoing diplomatic crisis targeting Qatar, trying to use its influence to end the monthslong dispute, authorities told The Associated Press on Friday.While offering few details, the acknowledgement by the U.S. military’s Central Command shows the concern it has over the conflict gripping the Gulf, home to the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet and crucial bases for its campaign against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, as well as the war in Afghanistan.The Qatar crisis began June 5, when Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates launched an economic boycott while closing off the energy-rich nation’s land border and its air and sea routes. The quartet of Arab nations pointed to Qatar’s alleged support of extremists and overly warm ties to Iran. Qatar long has denied supporting extremists and shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran that makes its citizens have the highest per-capita income in the world.Initially, U.S. military officials said the boycott and dispute had no impact on their operations. Qatar is home to the massive al-Udeid Air Base, the forward headquarters of Central Command which oversees the U.S.-led coalition’s bombing campaign of the Islamic State group and manages a direct line to Russia to manage Syria’s crowded skies.But as the dispute went on, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis traveled to Doha to offer his support. The Trump administration also agreed to an in-the-works sale of F-15 fighter jets to Qatar for $12 billion.Responding to queries from the AP, Air Force Col. John Thomas, a Central Command spokesman, acknowledged it would be cutting back on the exercises.“We are opting out of some military exercises out of respect for the concept of inclusiveness and shared regional interests,” Thomas said in a statement. “We will continue to encourage all partners to work together toward the sort of common solutions that enable security and stability in the region.”Officials in Qatar did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while the boycotting nations have not acknowledged the disruption in military exercises with the U.S.The Qatar diplomatic crisis has torn apart the typically clubby Gulf Cooperation Council, a regional Arab bloc created in part as a counterbalance to Iran. The U.S. military holds exercises in part to build the confidence of local forces, many of which use American-made equipment.Among the exercises likely to be affected is Eagle Resolve, an annual exercise held since 1999 that has GCC countries send forces alongside Americans to simulate working as a multinational force in battle. This year’s Eagle Resolve exercise, held in Kuwait in March, involved 1,000 U.S. troops.U.S. and Gulf allies also have regularly held joint, smaller-scale exercises in the region.The American military’s decision comes after an influential Republican senator said in June he’d withhold approval of U.S. weapons sales to several Middle Eastern allies. Those moves together signal to Gulf countries that American officials want the crisis resolved sooner than later, said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.“U.S. officials could be using a pressure point to express their frustration that what they see as a needless crisis and a distraction from far more urgent regional issues is going on so long,” Ulrichsen told the AP. “It is likely an indication to longstanding security and defense partners that U.S. patience on this spat is not open-ended and is rapidly drawing to a close.” "

0593cfb8e2e7004dc3b241635c809d72,"A lab technician holds medication used to treat COVID-19In a sigh of relief, the World Health Organisation (WHO) based on the research said that cheap steroids may reduce death rate in seriously ill coronavirus patients. The data was pooled from 121 hospitals in eight countries by clinicians and scientists have found that inexpensive, widely available steroids improve the odds in very sick corona patients and will survive the illness. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published the analysis conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO).Based on the newly-published data, the WHO has issued new treatment guidelines calling for corticosteroids to become the standard of care for patients with ""severe and critical"" Covid-19.Such patients should receive 7-10 days of treatment, a WHO panel said, cautioning against the use of steroids in patients with non-severe illness, saying that ""indiscriminate use of any therapy for Covid-19 would potentially rapidly deplete global resources and deprive the patients who may benefit from it most as potentially life-saving therapy.""""It is relatively rare in medicine that you find drugs where the evidence of their effectiveness in saving lives is so consistent,"" said lead author of the study Derek Angus, Professor and Chair at the Department of Critical Care Medicine in the University of Pittsburgh.""This is, in many respects, the single clearest answer we've had so far on how to manage terribly-ill Covid-19 patients. People on ventilators or oxygen and under intensive care should definitely be given corticosteroids,"" Angus added.This research suggested that steroids improve the survival of the sickest Covid-19 patients.""At the beginning of the year, at times it felt almost hopeless, knowing that we had no specific treatments. It was a very worrying time. Yet less than six months later, we've found clear, reliable evidence in high quality clinical trials as to how we can tackle this devastating disease,"" said Professor Gordon, Chair in Anaesthesia and Critical Care at the Imperial College London.These findings offer further evidence that corticosteroids can be an important part of Covid-19 treatment for severe patients.Steroids are anti-inflammatory drugs, and evidence strongly suggests that they reduce the lung inflammation in patients with Covid-19 who are seriously ill and require oxygen support for their breathing difficulties.The findings were made through the ""Randomized Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform-Community Acquired Pneumonia"" (REMAP-CAP).REMAP-CAP is one of seven randomised control trials to test corticosteroids for treating Covid-19 in critically-ill patients.Between March and June, the REMAP-CAP corticosteroid trial randomised 403 adult Covid-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit to receive the steroid hydrocortisone or no steroids at all.The trial found 93 per cent probability that giving patients a seven-day intravenous course of hydrocortisone would result in better outcomes than not giving the steroid.The results were consistent across age, race and sex.REMAP-CAP and the other corticosteroid trials did not test the drugs in patients with less severe Covid-19.Other groups, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, have already issued similar guidelines recommending the use of steroids to treat patients with severe Covid-19.(With Inputs from Agencies)"

The shooting on Saturday night killed Londre Sylvester, 31, a police report said. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.Sylvester had just been released after being fitted for electronic monitoring and was walking to a waiting vehicle when several suspects “exited two separate vehicles and all began to shoot in Sylvester’s direction, striking him numerous times,” the police report said.The killing comes amid a rise in shootings this year in Chicago and broader concerns nationwide about increasing violence. On Monday, Chicago police Superintendent David Brown was among city and law enforcement leaders from around the United States meeting with President Joe Biden about efforts to reduce crime.Following Saturday night’s shooting, the suspects reentered their vehicles and fled the scene, police said.A 60-year-old woman who was with Sylvester was shot in one of her knees and was hospitalized in good condition, police said. A second woman, who is in her 30s, suffered a graze wound to her mouth, police said.Sylvester had posted $5,000 bail on Friday, the Chicago Tribune reported. He had been ordered held on $50,000 bail on July 1 after prosecutors last month hit him with a petition for violation of bail bond for allegedly failing to meet conditions of his release in a 2020 felony gun case.ALSO READ | Florida resident detained as key suspect in Haiti killingALSO READ | Protests erupt in Georgia after beaten journalist dies"

7ae6aac9d27e43e3b2bacd6af960e148,"Vladimir Putin signs law banning 'extremists' from running in electionsRussian has banned individuals designated as ""extremists"" from running for public offices, a move condemned by the opposition as an effort to further limit political competition. By signing a new law on Friday, the day which also marks the birthday of jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny, President Vladimir Putin banned people who have been involved in ""extremism"" or ""terrorism"" from running for public sectors. CNN reported that the law prevents members of ""extremist"" or ""terrorist"" organizations from standing in elections for a period of three to five years, depending on the person's position. Founders and leaders of designated groups will not be able to run for elected office for five years after a court's decision to ban the group. Employees or financial supporters of court-ruled extremist and terrorist organizations will be banned from running for office for three years. Navalny was imprisoned earlier this year by a Moscow court for allegedly violating the probation terms of a 2014 case in which he received a suspended sentence of three and a half years. Navalny's chief of staff Leonid Volkov tweeted on Friday he didn't believe Putin ""accidentally"" signed the law today. The new legislation comes ahead of a court decision on whether to designate both Navalny's political and anti-corruption organizations as extremist groups following a lawsuit filed in April by the Moscow Prosecutor's Office. A political analyst of Carnegie Moscow and founder of R Politik, Tatiana Stanovaya said that the law threatens not only opposition politicians but ordinary Russian citizens. ""The law is part of a larger campaign against anti-regime behavior in Russia,"" she said. ""The battlefield has become much larger, now even a Russian citizen who participates in protests, retweets an opposition post or donates to opposition groups, face the risk of prosecution."" The new legislation signed by Putin means Navalny supporters face the possibility of being barred from running in Russia's upcoming parliamentary elections in September. Navalny was already barred from running in Russia's last presidential election in 2018 because of his conviction. Russia's next presidential election is scheduled for 2024.

d1a69bbcf4ad11d228a01d8fbaeac540,"UK and EU reach Brexit deal; still needs ratificationBritain and the European Union said Thursday that they have struck an outline Brexit deal after days of intense see-saw negotiations — though it must still be formally approved by the bloc and ratified by the European and U.K. Parliaments.Hours before a summit of all 28 EU national leaders, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted: “We have one! It’s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that the two sides had struck a “great new deal” and urged U.K. lawmakers to ratify it in a special session on SaturdayThe breakthrough came just hours after Johnson’s Northern Irish government allies threw a spanner in the works by saying they couldn’t support the draft agreement because of provisions for the Irish border.The prime minister needs all the support he can get to push any deal past a deeply divided Parliament.It only added to the high anxiety that reigned on Thursday morning, as the last outstanding issues of the divorce papers were hammered out.Technical negotiators again went into the night Wednesday to fine-tune customs and sales tax regulations that will have to regulate trade in goods between the Northern Ireland and Ireland — where the U.K. and the EU share their only land border.After months of gloom over the stalled Brexit process, European leaders have sounded upbeat this week. French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that “I want to believe that a deal is being finalized,” while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said negotiations were “in the final stretch.”Johnson — who took office in July vowing Britain would finally leave the EU on Oct. 31, come what may — was slightly more cautious. He likened Brexit to climbing Mount Everest, saying the summit was in sight, though still shrouded in cloud.Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party added to those clouds early Thursday. DUP leader Arlene Foster and the party’s parliamentary chief Nigel Dodds said they “could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues,” referring to a say the Northern Irish authorities might have in future developments.Both the customs and consent arrangements are key to guaranteeing an open border between the U.K.’s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland — the main obstacle to a Brexit deal.Foster and Dodds said they would continue to work with the U.K. government to get a “sensible” deal. The problem is that the closer Johnson aligns himself with the DUP, the further he removes himself from the EU, leaving him walking a political tightrope.Brexit negotiations have been here before — seemingly closing in on a deal that is dashed at the last moment. But hopes have risen that this time may be different."

Read full reportSunitha gave a detailed presentation highlighting the strengths of Indian tobacco, it said.She said that Indian tobacco is of high quality, organically cultivated and pesticide residue free. India is the only country in the world where tobacco is produced in two seasons, it said.She also mentioned that India due to its proximity could bring down the logistic costs in exporting tobacco to China. India is the third largest producer and exporter of unmanufactured tobacco with exports more than Rs 5,000 crores to more than 115 destinations including quality-conscious markets of Japan and Europe, it said.Thus, India is well positioned to supply superior tobacco with consistency in price, volume, quality, and compliance, Sunitha said. However, India’s exports to China has been negligible, she added. China produces 42 per cent cigarettes globally. It is also the world's largest producer and consumer of Tobacco.During the talks, Zhang said, “while Indian tobacco may not be currently suitable for the Chinese market, STMA will be happy to work with the Indian Tobacco Board to further leverage complementarities” in the background of growing bilateral relations between India and China, the press release said.The Tobacco Board offered that with the production processes matching global standards, India will be able to produce and offer tobacco varieties which suit China, it said. Zhang said that he will depute a government and industry delegation to India to further explore the opportunities. Earlier this year, China extended protocol, which has remained dormant, on the export of Indian tobacco leaves during the visit of Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan to China in January.Since then, the Indian Embassy here has worked with the Chinese authorities such as STMA, Ministry of Commerce and other relevant organisations for promoting Indian tobacco, the press release said.Prashant Lokhande, Commercial Counsellor of the Indian Embassy said China should address the trade deficit as the bilateral trade is expected to touch USD 100 billion mark this year. The trade deficit according to China's official figures crossed USD 57 billion last year.Officials of India and China have been working to address India's concerns since last year's informal Wuhan summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.Following the meeting, China has begun import of some of the agricultural produce from India like rice, sugar and soybean. Efforts are on by both the countries to increase India's exports of IT and Pharmaceuticals. "
f1e235656333059ca1a132370470d788,"Russian forces doing everything to evacuate Indian citizens from Sumy: Putin assures ModiUkraine-Russia war: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi that his forces are doing everything to evacuate the stranded Indian citizens, mostly students, from the war-torn eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, according to his office.During the 50-minute telephonic conversation, Prime Minister Modi conveyed his ""deep concern"" over the safety and security of the Indian students stuck in Sumy city and sought their evacuation at the earliest.Around 700 Indian students are stranded in Sumy amid intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops and India has been urging both sides to create a ""humanitarian corridor"" for their safe evacuation.President Putin, in the telephone conversation with Prime Minister Modi, said that Russian military personnel are doing everything to evacuate Indian citizens from Sumy, the state-owned TASS news agency reported, citing the Kremlin.""It has been noted that the Indian students who were held by the radicals in Kharkov managed to leave the city only as a result of strong international pressure on the Kiev authorities,"" the Kremlin alleged.""Russian military personnel are making every effort to ensure the evacuation of Indian citizens from the city of Sumy,” it said. Modi thanked the Russian side ""for the measures taken to ensure the return of his compatriots to their homeland,” it added.On Saturday, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in New Delhi that India's main focus is now on evacuating the students from Sumy, and that the safe exit of Indians from Kharkiv and Pisochyn is almost complete.""We are deeply concerned about Indian students in Sumy, Ukraine. Have strongly pressed Russian and Ukrainian governments through multiple channels for an immediate ceasefire to create a safe corridor for our students,"" Bagchi said.Bagchi also said the main challenge remains the ongoing shelling and violence in Sumy and lack of transportation.Last week, the Indian students in Sumy had posted videos saying they have decided to leave for the Russian border and that the Indian government and the embassy in Ukraine will be responsible if anything happens to them.Following the embassy's assurance, the students did not leave the eastern Ukrainian city that has seen intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops.Putin told Modi that Ukrainian nationalists ""continue to prevent the withdrawal of civilians from dangerous zones,” the Kremlin said.""Vladimir Putin informed the Prime Minister of India that, given the aggravation of the humanitarian situation, the Russian Armed Forces announced the introduction of a regime of silence today and the opening of humanitarian corridors,"" it said.Asked about Putin's comments on Thursday that some Indians are being held hostage by Ukrainian forces, Bagchi had on Friday again rejected the claim, saying India does not have any such information or reports.On Thursday too, Bagchi rejected claims by both Russia and Ukraine that Indian students are being held hostage in Kharkiv.It was the third telephonic conversation between the two leaders after the military conflict began in Ukraine on February 24.India has brought back nearly 16,000 of its nationals in 76 flights under mission ""Operation Ganga"" which was launched on February 26 following Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, according to officials in New Delhi.India has been urging both Russian and Ukrainian authorities to create a safe passage for the students to either move to the Russian border or to western Ukraine for their exit to Romania, Hungary or Poland.Prime Minister Modi has expressed deep concern about the ongoing conflict and resultant humanitarian crisis and reiterated his call for immediate cessation of violence. "
b58cb190c4f4deddd4f237c2651304a2,"Saudi Arabia: Drone attacks knocked out half its oil supplyYemen’s Houthi rebels launched drone attacks on the world’s largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia and a major oil field Saturday, sparking huge fires and halting about half of the supplies from the world’s largest exporter of oil.The attacks were the latest of many drone assaults on the kingdom’s oil infrastructure assaults in recent weeks, but easily the most damaging. They raise concerns about the global oil supply and likely will further increase tensions across the Persian Gulf amid an escalating crisis between the U.S. and Iran over its unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.The attacks resulted in “the temporary suspension of production operations” at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and the Khurais oil field, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said in a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. The fires “were controlled,” the statement said, and no workers were injured.The fires led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels in crude supplies, according to the statement, which said part of that would be offset with stockpiles. The statement said Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, would provide updated information in the next 48 hours.The Iranian-backed Houthis, who hold Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and other territory in the Arab world’s poorest country, took responsibility for the attacks in the war against a Saudi-led coalition that has fought since 2015 to reinstate the internationally recognized Yemeni government. But the U.S. blamed Iran, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeting, “There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.”“Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply,” Pompeo added.Image Source : APSaudi Arabia: Drone attacks knocked out half its oil supplySaudi Arabia: Drone attacks knocked out half its oil supplyIn a short address aired by the Houthi’s Al-Masirah satellite news channel, military spokesman Yahia Sarie said the rebels launched 10 drones after receiving “intelligence” support from those inside the kingdom. He warned that attacks by the rebels would only get worse if the war continues.“The only option for the Saudi government is to stop attacking us,” Sarie said.Houthi rebels have been using drones in combat since the start of the Saudi-led war. The first appeared to be off-the-shelf, hobby-kit-style drones. Later, versions nearly identical to Iranian models turned up. Iran denies supplying the Houthis with weapons, although the U.N., the West and Gulf Arab nations say Tehran does.U.N. investigators said the Houthis’ new UAV-X drone likely has a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (930 miles). That puts the far reaches of both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in range.First word of Saturday’s assault came in online videos of giant fires at the Abqaiq facility, some 330 kilometers (205 miles) northeast of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Machine-gun fire could be heard in several clips alongside the day’s first Muslim call to prayers, suggesting security forces tried to bring down the drones just before dawn. In daylight, Saudi state television aired a segment with its local correspondent near a police checkpoint, a thick plume of smoke visible behind him.President Donald Trump called Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to offer his support for the kingdom’s defense, the White House said. The crown prince assured Trump that Saudi Arabia is “willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression,” according to a news release from the Saudi Embassy in Washington.Saudi Aramco describes its Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq as “the largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world.”The facility processes sour crude oil into sweet crude, then transports it onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea or to refineries for local production. Estimates suggest it can process up to 7 million barrels of crude oil a day. By comparison, Saudi Arabia produced 9.65 million barrels of crude oil a day in July.“This is one of the biggest central processing facilities in the world. The Iran conflict is going to be hitting the world in a new way,” said Kevin Book, managing director, research at ClearView Energy Partners LLC.Image Source : APSaudi Arabia: Drone attacks knocked out half its oil supplySaudi Arabia: Drone attacks knocked out half its oil supplyThe Khurais oil field is believed to produce over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day. It has estimated reserves of over 20 billion barrels of oil, according to Aramco.There was no immediate impact on global oil prices as markets were closed for the weekend. Benchmark Brent crude had been trading at just above $60 a barrel.While Saudi Arabia has taken steps to protect itself and its oil infrastructure, analysts had warned that Abqaiq remained vulnerable. The Rapidan Energy Group, a Washington-based advisory group, warned in May that “a successful attack could lead to a monthslong disruption of most Saudi production and nearly all spare production.” It called Abqaiq, close to the eastern Saudi city of Dammam, “the most important oil facility in the world.”In a report published Saturday, Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, noted that although Aramco officials have indicated that exports will resume in the next few days, “there is nothing to suggest that this is a one-off event and that the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels will forgo further strikes on Saudi sites.”Also Read | Saudi Aramco's largest oil facility attacked by drones; 10 things to knowThe war has become the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

bbd0ba936b7d4680dd1581271d336e85,"Vijay Mallya loses bankruptcy petition amendment High Court battle in UKA consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday moved a step closer in their attempt to recover debt from loans paid out to Vijay Mallya’s now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines after the High Court in London upheld an application to amend their bankruptcy petition, in favour of waiving their security over the embattled businessman’s assets in India.Chief Insolvencies and Companies Court (ICC) Judge Michael Briggs handed down his judgment in favour of the banks to declare there is no public policy that prevents a waiver of security rights, as argued by Mallya’s lawyers.At a virtual hearing, July 26 was set as the date for final arguments for and against granting a bankruptcy order against the 65-year-old Mallya after the banks accused him of trying to “kick matters into the long grass” and called on the “bankruptcy petition to be brought to its inevitable end”.“I order that permission be given to amend the petition to read as follows: ‘The Petitioners (banks) having the right to enforce any security held are willing, in the event of a bankruptcy order being made, to give up any such security for the benefit of all the bankrupt’s creditors’,” Justice Briggs’ judgment reads.“There is nothing in the statutory provisions that prevent the Petitioners from giving up security,” he notes.Mallya’s barrister, Philip Marshall, had referenced witness statements of retired Indian judges in previous hearings to reiterate that there is “public interest under Indian law” by virtue of the banks being nationalised.However, Justice Briggs found no impediment to the creditors relinquishing their security under Indian law because of the engagement of a “principle concerning public interest” and favoured the submissions made by retired Indian Supreme Court judge Gopala Gowda at a hearing in December 2020 on the matter.“In my judgment the simple stance taken by Justice Gowda that Section 47 PIA 1920 is evidence of the ability of a secured creditor to relinquish the creditor’s security is to be preferred,” the ruling notes.The Indian banks, represented by the law firm TLT LLP and barrister Marcia Shekerdemian, were also granted costs in totality for the petition hearings, as the “overall successful” party in the case.“Dr Mallya should have been extradited by now. He was refused permission to go to the Supreme Court in May last year,” Shekerdemian pointed out, in reference to one of Mallya’s defence planks that the cases against him are “politically motivated”.Mallya remains on bail in the UK while a “confidential” legal matter, believed to be related to an asylum application, is resolved in connection with the unrelated extradition proceedings.Meanwhile, the SBI-led consortium of 13 Indian banks, which also includes Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co Pvt Ltd as well as an additional creditor, have been pursuing a bankruptcy order in the UK in relation to a judgment debt which stands at over GBP 1 billion.Mallya’s legal team contends that the debt remains disputed and that the ongoing proceedings in India inhibit a bankruptcy order being made in the UK.“The pandemic is having a much more severe impact in India than here, which has slowed things up. Dr Mallya would like things to be faster,” said his barrister Philip Marshall.The case is now scheduled for a day-long hearing on July 26 for Justice Briggs to hear arguments from both sides on whether there is any reason why it should look “behind the judgment debt” to consider all such factors and therefore not grant a bankruptcy order.Presenting a brief background to the petition, which dates back to 2018, the latest judgment describes Mallya as an “entrepreneur businessman” who had considerable financial success in India and other parts of the world as Chief Executive Officer and shareholder of Kingfisher Airways (KFA) and controlling director and main shareholder in United Breweries Holdings Ltd (UBHL).“The cost of aviation fuel rose in 2008, and the value of the rupee declined against the dollar. Dr Mallya decided to borrow substantial sums from some of the Petitioners,” the judgment reads.“Dr Mallya provided personal guarantees for the sums borrowed from the Petitioners in 2010. UBHL also provided a guarantee,” it adds.The debt in question comprises principal and interest, plus compound interest at a rate of 11.5 per cent per annum from 25 June 2013. Mallya has made applications in India to contest the compound interest charge. ALSO READ: Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi all coming back to face law of land: Sitharaman in Rajya SabhaALSO READ: Vijay Mallya has applied for ‘another route’ to stay in the UK, says lawyer"
3e69ed324a22d4facc72dd6749fad323,"Far-right extremists are moving increasingly online as they prepare for what they believe is a ""civil war on Islam"" in Britain, according to a new report released on Friday by a UK-based anti-racism group.Hope Not Hate, a campaign group which investigates neo-Nazi groups to combat far-right extremism, warns that the UK must be prepared for more terrorist plots and use of extreme violence from the far-right for the foreseeable future.""We are facing a surging threat from far-right terrorism and violent extremism. We fear further violence from the extreme right in the months to come,"" said Nick Lowles, chief executive of Hope Not Hate.""This rising terrorist threat is the consequence of the increasingly confrontational tone of online far-right rhetoric, combined with the almost universal extreme-right belief that a civil war between Islam and the West is coming,"" he added.He called on the police and the government to do more to crack down on the peddlers of hate and those pushing a ""civil war rhetoric"".The group's annual State of Hate report said that while traditional groups are weakening, more tech-savvy leaders were driving the far-right cause forward.It warns that though membership of traditionally-organised far-right groups was at its lowest level for two decades, the threat that they posed has been replaced by new networks which had been developing online.These new activists have been growing in size and influence and have developed new ways of marketing themselves to would-be followers which differentiated themselves from the stereotypical face of the far-right of the past.This rise in virtual activity was contributing to more online race or religious hatred, much of it aimed at Muslims, the report notes.A record number of people are being arrested for suspected terror offences in the UK, with 28 suspects detained for far-right-inspired crimes in 2017, according to the campaign group.The report said that the view of Islam itself as a threat had spread into the mainstream and the general British population, with more than half of respondents in a public poll taking the position and 42 per cent saying their distrust of Muslims had grown after last years Islamic State (ISIS) inspired attacks.""With increasingly negative views towards British Muslims - and Islam more generally - there is a growing pool of possible recruits for the far right and, with some now having huge social media platforms, they now have ways to reach people that were unimaginable in the past,"" the report notes.The findings come just days after Scotland Yard's outgoing counter-terrorism chief Mark Rowley warned of the growing threat from the far right.He used a speech earlier this week to reveal that the UK had foiled four far-right terrorist plots in 2017.""The right-wing threat was not previously organised. Every now and then there's been an individual motivated by that rhetoric who has committed a terrorist act but we've not had an organised right-wing threat like we do now,"" he had warned.The new report supports this assertion, warning further violence from the extreme right.""At its heart this report shines a light on the growth of intolerance across the UK and Europe and we should all take a stand against extremism whether it is expressed by far right, Islamist groups or other movements,"" said UK security minister Ben Wallace.He said the government was determined to crack down on terrorist recruiters who preyed on vulnerable people, whether by ""Islamists, neo-Nazis or other violent extremists""."
a2d87e85b0310533c1385307475326e5,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk introduces the Cybertruck at Teslas design studio.  Elon Musk's huge Twitter investment took a new twist Tuesday with the filing of a lawsuit alleging that the colourful billionaire illegally delayed disclosing his stake in the social media company so he could buy more shares at lower prices. The complaint in New York federal court accuses Musk of violating a regulatory deadline to reveal he had accumulated a stake of at least 5 per cent. Instead, according to the complaint, Musk didn't disclose his position in Twitter until he'd almost doubled his stake to more than 9 per cent. That strategy, the lawsuit alleges, hurt less wealthy investors who sold shares in the San Francisco company in the nearly two weeks before Musk acknowledged holding a major stake.Musk's regulatory filings show that he bought a little more than 620,000 shares at USD 36.83 apiece on Jan.31 and then continued to accumulate more shares on nearly every single trading day through April 1. Musk, best known as CEO of the electric car maker Tesla, held 73.1 million Twitter shares as of the most recent count Monday. That represents a 9.1 per cent stake in Twitter. The lawsuit alleges that by March 14, Musk's stake in Twitter had reached a 5% threshold that required him to publicly disclose his holdings under U.S.securities law by March 24. Musk didn't make the required disclosure until April 4.That revelation caused Twitter's stock to soar 27 per cent from its April 1 close to nearly USD 50 by the end of April 4's trading, depriving investors who sold shares before Musk's improperly delayed disclosure the chance to realize significant gains, according to the lawsuit filed on behalf of an investor named Marc Bain Rasella. Musk, meanwhile, was able to continue to buy shares that traded in prices ranging from $37.69 to $40.96.The lawsuit is seeking to be certified as a class action representing Twitter shareholders who sold shares between March 24 per centand April 4, a process that could take a year or more. Musk spent about $2.6 billion on Twitter stock — a fraction of his estimated wealth of $265 billion, the largest individual fortune in the world. In a regulatory filing Monday, Musk disclosed he may increase his stake after backing out of an agreement reached last week to join Twitter's board of directors.Jacob Walker, one of the lawyers that filed the lawsuit against Musk, told The Associated Press that he hadn't reached out to the Securities and Exchange Commission about Musk's alleged violations about the disclosure of his Twitter stake. “I assume the SEC is well aware of what he did,"" Walker said. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.The SEC and Musk have been wrangling in court since 2018 when Musk and Tesla agreed to pay a USD 40 million fine to settle allegations that he used his Twitter account to mislead investors about a potential buyout of the electric car company that never materialized. As part of that deal, Musk was supposed to obtain legal approval for his tweets about information that could affect Tesla's stock price — a provision that regulators contend he has occasionally violated and that he now argues unfairly muzzles him.Musk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment posted on Twitter, where he often shares his opinion and thoughts. Alex Spiro, a New York lawyer representing Musk in his ongoing dispute with the SEC, also didn't immediately respond to a query from The Associated Press.Also Read | Elon Musk not to join Twitter board, says CEO Parag Agrawal"

289c75f0eb43fc251728e53b89b4f060,"Latest shift to Power, newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron laid the ground work for Monday, announcing a visit to Germany, a namechange for his political movement and appearing with his predecessor at a solemn World War II commemoration.Macron handily defeated far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen in Sunday’s presidential runoff, and now must pull together a majority of lawmakers for his year-old political movement to run in the mid-June legislative election.His party is changing its name to La Republique En Marche (Republic on the Move) as it prepares a list of candidates. Macron has promised that half of those candidates will be new to elected politics, as he was before his victory Sunday.Macron won the presidency with 66 percent of votes cast for a candidate. But a high number of blank or spoiled votes and unusually low turnout are signs of an electorate dissatisfied with its choices.Le Pen says she will lead the opposition to Macron.On Monday, a French national holiday, the president-elect joined President Francois Hollande in commemoration of the end of World War II. The holiday marks the day of the formal German defeat in World War II.It was the first time the men had appeared in public together since Macron resigned in August 2016 as Hollande’s economy minister to run for president — a decision that was received coldly by the French leader at the time, according to French media.On Monday, though, Hollande gripped Macron’s arm before the two men walked side by side and then announced the transfer of power would take place on Sunday, a week after the election.Monday also marked decades of peace in Western Europe, something Macron made a cornerstone of his campaign against Le Pen’s brand of populism. Le Pen called for France to leave the European Union and drop the euro currency in favor of the franc.Sylvie Goulard, a French deputy to the European Parliament, said Macron would make Berlin his first official visit, with perhaps a stop to see French troops stationed abroad as well.The National Front, meanwhile, is also gearing up for a name change — if not a makeover of its ideas — after Le Pen’s decisive loss. In interviews Monday, National Front officials said the party founded by her father would get a new name to try and draw in a broader spectrum of supporters.“The National Front is a tool that will evolve to be more efficient, bring even more people together after the number of voters we reached last night. And so we have an immense responsibility vis-a-vis the French people, who trust us,” said Nicolas Bay, the party’s secretary-general.Michael Roth, Germany’s deputy foreign minister, applauded Macron’s win but said the result was marred by the fact that 11 million people in France voted for Le Pen.“It mustn’t become normal that right-wing extremists and populists achieve such strong results,” said Roth, whose portfolio includes relations with France. He suggested relaxing European Union rules on state spending to allow France to boost its economic growth.“If Macron fails, then the next president will be Marine Le Pen and we need to prevent this at all costs,” he added. On the financial front, European stock markets edged down in early trading as investors had been widely expecting Macron’s victory.Though Macron’s victory is considered positive for the region’s economy and the euro currency, stocks had risen strongly in the previous two weeks on expectations of his win. France’s CAC 40 index, which last week touched the highest level since early 2008, slipped 0.8 percent to 5,391 on Monday.Germany’s DAX was down 0.3 percent at 12,683 and Britain’s FTSE 100 was up 0.1 percent at 7,301.The euro, which had risen Sunday night in the wake of the news of Macron’s victory, edged back down 0.5 percent to $1.0943"

In a series of tweets, Rhodes attacked President Donald Trump and his policy towards Iran. ""No question that Soleimani has a lot of blood on his hands. But this is a really frightening moment. Iran will respond and likely in various places. Thinking of all US personnel in the region right now.,"" said Rhodes. He added, ""Trump may have just started a war with no congressional debate. I really hope the worst-case scenario doesn’t happen but everything about this situation suggests serious escalation to come.""Rhodes also called for Congress' interference in the matter, ""Congress has to assert itself and determine exactly what our Iran policy is. Did we mean to do this? Do we have any plan for what comes next? What is the legal basis for all this?.""When Trump tweeted an American flag from his twitter handle, Rhodes retweeted the flag and wrote, ""What is the strategy?

We don't know where the body is,"" Jubeir said.As of now, 18 Saudi suspects have been taken into custody in connection with the incident and two senior Saudi officials fired.""The individuals who did this, did this outside the scope of their authority. There obviously was a tremendous mistake made, and what compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover up,"" Jubeir said.""That is unacceptable in any government. These things unfortunately happen. We want to make sure that those who are responsible are punished, and we want to make sure we have procedures in place to prevent it from happening again.""Jubeir insisted, however, that the operation was not ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite reports tying some suspects to members of the de facto ruler's security detail.""This was an operation that was a rogue operation, this was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding their authorities and responsibilities they had; they made a mistake when they killed Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate and they tried to cover up for it,"" he said.Meanwhile, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his US counterpart Donald Trump agreed in telephone talks on Sunday that the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul needed to be clarified.""The two leaders agreed that the Jamal Khashoggi case should be clarified in all its aspects,"" a Turkish presidential source said.(With agency inputs)"

He also demanded a secular “liberal” government shorn of the religious and ultra-Orthodox allies the prime minister has long relied upon.Image Source : AP PM Netanyahu faces uphill battle after repeat electionPM Netanyahu faces uphill battle after repeat election“The conclusion is clear, everything we said throughout the campaign is coming true,” he said outside his home in the West Bank settlement of Nokdim. “There is one and only option: a national unity government that is broad and liberal and we will not join any other option.”That could spell serious trouble for the continuation of Netanyahu’s lengthy rule.Gantz, a former military chief, has ruled out sitting with a Netanyahu-led Likud at a time when the prime minister is expected to be indicted on corruption charges in the coming weeks. It raised the specter of an alternate Likud candidate rising to challenge Netanyahu, though most of its senior officials have thus far pledged to stand solidly behind their leader.Netanyahu, the longest serving leader is Israeli history, had desperately sought an outright majority with his hard-line and ultra-Orthodox allies in hopes of passing legislation to give him immunity from his expected indictment.Israel’s attorney general has recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three scandals, pending a long-awaited hearing scheduled in the coming weeks. A formal indictment would increase the pressure on Netanyahu to step aside if he does not have immunity.Near-final results released Wednesday by the Central Election Commission had Blue and White with 32 seats out of the 120 in parliament and edging past Likud, who had 31. The tally is based on a count of 63% of eligible voters. Overall turnout was 69.4%.According to the partial results, Likud with its natural allies of religious and ultra-nationalist parties mustered just 55 seats — or six short of the needed majority."

(Saudi Press Agency via AP)Saudi Arabia has released photos of King Salman carrying out his royal duties after theories emerged on his death and a possible coup attempt. The speculation began after the arrest of two senior princes.Two people close to the royal family said that the two princes were arrested for not supporting Crown Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated control of all major levers of power inside the kingdom with the support of his father, King Salman. Earlier on Friday, the brother and nephew of the Saudi King were arrested over a plot to oust him and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch's nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were accused of treason.A source added that the arrests sent a message to anyone in the royal family feeling disenfranchised: Stop grumbling and toe the line because if Prince Ahmed can be arrested, any prince can and will be. Prince Ahmed was seen as a person who royals could look to when feeling vexed with the crown prince's grip on power, the person said.Saudi King Salman reads a document as he receives two newly appointed Saudi ambassadors at his palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Sunday, March 8, 2020.

In the king's first appearance since then, state media showed the 84-year-old king on Sunday standing and greeting two Saudi diplomats being sworn in as ambassadors. He has previously been seen Thursday meeting with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab in Riyadh.The arrests came as a surprise, given that Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 60, was widely known to be under close surveillance since he was shunted out of the line of succession by the king's son in mid-2017, a person close to the royal court said.The arrest of Prince Ahmed, 78, was also unexpected since he is the king's full younger brother and also a senior member of the ruling Al Saud family.Prince Ahmed, however, has long held unfavourable views of the crown prince and was one of just a few senior princes to abstain from pledging allegiance to him when the young royal sidelined more senior princes to become first in line to the throne.Both princes had served previously in the post of interior minister, overseeing security and surveillance inside the kingdom.(With AP inputs)"

As many as 121 others are on ventilators in serious condition.The Indian consignment reached Israel within days after Netanyahu spoke to Modi on April 3, requesting supply of hydroxychloroquine, with India being the world's largest producer and exporter of the drug.India, however, had to restrict its export to meet domestic contingencies.Netanyahu had been in touch with Modi ever since the coronavirus crisis erupted.

That brought known drownings in the Naf River to 88 since the crisis began.Those who arrived on Wednesday in wooden boats on beaches near Shah Porir Dwip fishing village described ongoing violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where smoke could be seen billowing from a burning village - suggesting more Rohingya homes had been set alight.One Rohingya man said his village of Rashidong had been attacked six days earlier by Myanmar soldiers and police.""When military and police surrounded our village and attacked us with rocket launchers to set fire, we got away from our village and fled away to any direction we could manage,"" Abdul Goffar said.Myanmar presidential office spokesman Zaw Htay said that out of 471 ""Bengali"" villages in three Rakhine townships, 176 were now completely empty while at least 34 more were partially abandoned. Many in Myanmar use that term as part of the long-standing refusal to accept Rohingya as citizens of the country.Myanmar has accused the Rohingya of burning their own homes and villages - a claim the U.N. human rights chief criticised as a ""complete denial of reality.""10,000 PEOPLE CROSSED BORDERS IN PAST 24 HOURSU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters at U.N. headquarters on Thursday that 10,000 people reportedly crossed the border that in the last 24 hours.Combined with the Rohingyas who fled during the last round of violence in Rakhine state last October, Dujarric said ""it's estimated that some 40 per cent of the total Rohingya population have now fled into Bangladesh.""An estimated 60 per cent of the Rohingyas arriving in Bangladesh are children, Dujarric said.ROHINGYA CRISIS STARTED ON AUGUST 25The crisis and refugee exodus began on August 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts. Myanmar's military retaliated with ""clearance operations"" to root out the rebels, but the fleeing Rohingya say Myanmar soldiers shot indiscriminately, burned their homes and warned them to leave or die. Others have said they were attacked by Buddhist mobs. Hundreds have died, mostly Rohingya, and some of the refugees have needed treatment for bullet wounds.Facing growing condemnation globally, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi will not attend U.N. General Assembly meetings September 19-25 to instead deal with what the government said were domestic security issues.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters on Wednesday that ethnic cleansing was taking place against Rohingya in Rakhine state. The term ""ethnic cleansing"" is defined as an effort to rid an area of an unwanted ethnic group - by displacement, deportation or even killing.And Amnesty International said on Thursday that it has turned up evidence of an ""orchestrated campaign of systematic burnings"" by Myanmar security forces targeting dozens of Rohingya villages over the last three weeks.UNSC CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE STEPS TO END VIOLENCEThe U.N. Security Council has called for ""immediate steps to end the violence"" and ensure civilian protections. Rohingya have faced decades of persecution in Myanmar, and are denied citizenship despite centuries-old roots in the Rakhine region.The thousands of Rohingya flooding into Bangladesh every day have arrived hungry and traumatised. Many need urgent medical care for violence-related injuries, severe infections or childbirth.""The women who are coming for check-ups all have a terrified and exhausted look,"" said Sumaya, a midwife at the Nayapara refugee camp working in association with the U.N. population fund. ""We keep hearing stories from them of walking through jungles and across hills for days without food, their children carried over their shoulders. They've lost their homes.""Two existing refugee camps were packed beyond capacity, and Bangladesh has said it would free land to build a third. Many of the new arrivals were huddling in makeshift shelters along roads or in open fields. Near the camp of Balukhali, some were setting up tents made of bamboo and plastic along hillsides muddy from days of rain. Children walked uphill to capture rainwater before it spilled into the teeming settlements below.Food, clean water and other necessities were scarce.Panic erupted on Thursday along roadsides where local volunteers were distributing food, water and other supplies haphazardly from parked vehicles. Local officials shouted through bullhorns for volunteers to coordinate their efforts with aid agencies to avoid spreading chaos.""There are acute shortages of everything, most critically shelter, food and clean water,"" UNICEF country representative Edouard Beigbeder said.The U.N. children's agency said it needed $7.3 million to help just the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya children now at high risk of contracting water-borne diseases.On Thursday afternoon, a scuffle broke out at a makeshift relief center at Kutupalong, where some refugees tried to break into the center and were beaten back by at least four security guards wielding sticks.Those who managed to receive some aid after waiting hours in line were dismayed by the meager hand-out.""I have just got a tarpaulin sheet but no food,"" said 55-year-old Osman, who gave only one name. ""I need rice to eat, I need to feed my family. They said they can't give us anything else. What will I eat now?""U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said humanitarian assistance would increase ""very, very quickly."" Asked why the response has been slow, Grandi alluded to difficulties working in Bangladesh, but said he hoped this will change as the scale of the crisis becomes more apparent.It is the Myanmar government's ""responsibility to ensure that security returns to Rakhine,"" Grandi told The Associated Press at the Stockholm Security Conference in Sweden.Bangladesh already was housing some 500,000 Rohingya who fled earlier flashes of violence including anti-Muslim riots in 2012. Rakhine state had up to 1 million Rohingya before the latest violence."

It comes as drugmakers and research centers around the world scramble to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in an attempt to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 1.25 million lives worldwide.The finding was the result of the first independent analysis of any Covid-19 vaccine in phase 3 trials — the final stage before commercial licensing. The study found that 94 participants who received the two-dose vaccine were protected against the disease 28 days after their first inoculation.“Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO.“The first interim analysis of our global Phase 3 study provides evidence that a vaccine may effectively prevent COVID-19. This is a victory for innovation, science and a global collaborative effort,” said Prof. Ugur Sahin, BioNTech co-founder and CEO. The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27 and has enrolled 43,538 participants to date, 38,955 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 8, 2020. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The trial is continuing to enroll and is expected to continue through the final analysis when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. The shots made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech are among 10 possible vaccine candidates in late-stage testing around the world — four of them so far in huge studies in the U.S. Another U.S. company, Moderna Inc., also has said it hopes to be able to file an application with the Food and Drug Administration later this month.Volunteers in the final-stage studies, and the researchers, don’t know who received the real vaccine or a dummy shot. But a week after their second required dose, Pfizer’s study began counting the number who developed COVID-19 symptoms and were confirmed to have the coronavirus.Pfizer doesn’t plan to stop its study until it records 164 infections among all the volunteers, a number that the FDA has agreed is enough to tell how well the vaccine is working. The agency has made clear that any vaccine must be at least 50% effective.No participant so far has become severely ill, Gruber said. Nor could he provide a breakdown of how many of the infections had occurred in older people, who are at highest risk from COVID-19.Participants were tested only if they developed symptoms, leaving unanswered whether vaccinated people could get infected but show no symptoms and unknowingly spread the virus."

The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops were also found constructing barracks and other structures near the Pangong Lake. The intelligence agencies flagged that construction for 5G was noticed near Demchok area, one of the disputed sites at LAC, in the first week of August. The agencies noticed the installation of equipment for new spectrum bandwidths, laying of fibre optics cables and the development of cellular transmission technology.The agencies also alerted that fresh construction works were seen along the Pangong Lake despite China having stated they will move back.New huts and sheds have come up at Pangong Lake.This is happening even when both the countries are in dialogue for disengagement.The India-China standoff is nearing four months after tensions broke out in early May. While initial disengagement took place in Galwan Valley and Patrol Point 15; Pangong Lake and Gogra-Hot Springs area also known as patrol point 17A remains volatile.At Pangong Lake, China has strengthened its positions between Finger-5 and 8 and India is to take up this move very strongly.The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has refused to pull back eastwards from the 8-km stretch it has occupied from Finger-4 to Finger-8 by building scores of new fortifications there since early May.

""I just think it's an embarrassment quite frankly.... It will not help the president's legacy.... I know from my discussions with foreign leaders thus far that they are hopeful that the United States' democratic institutions are viewed once again as being strong and enduring,"" Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware.Responding to questions from reporters on Trump not conceding the race, Biden hoped that at the end it's all going to come to fruition on January 20th.""Between now and then my hope and expectation is that the American people do know and do understand that there has been a transition. Even among Republicans... who voted for the president, I understand the sense of loss. I get that,” he said.Biden hoped that those who voted for him and those for Trump would come together.""A significantly smaller number, but a lot voted for him -- I think they understand that we have to come together. I think they're ready to unite and I believe we can pull the country out of this bitter politics that we've seen for the last five, six and seven years,” he said.The President-elect said that he has already begun the transition. “We are well underway.

I'm confident that the fact that they are not willing to acknowledge we won at this point is not of much consequence in our planning and what we're able to do between now and January 20th,” he asserted.Referring to the congratulatory calls that he has had so far with six world leaders, he said that the response has been very fulsome, energetic, and they are all looking forward to being able to, from Great Britain to France to Germany to Canada, et cetera, and Ireland.""I feel good about the ability to.. I said when we announced that the next president is going to inherit a divided country and a world in disarray. The reception and welcome we've gotten around the world from our allies and our friends has been real and I have a number of other calls to return and so I feel confident that we're going to be able to put the American back in a place of respect that it had before,” he said.Responding to a question, Biden said that access to classified information is useful, but he is not in a position to make any decisions on those issues anyway.""As I said, one president at a time and he will be president until January 20th. It would be nice to have it, but it's not critical. We are just going to proceed the way we have.

2cd891f2d1b4d82ce5ad2b801679b3a9,"A SpaceX rocket carried 10 communications satellites into orbit from California, two days after the company successfully launched a satellite from Florida. The Falcon 9 rocket blasted off on Sunday through low- lying fog at 1.25 pm pacific daylight time (PDT) from Vandenberg Air Force Base northwest of Los Angeles. It carried a second batch of new satellites for Iridium Communications, which is replacing its orbiting fleet with a next-generation constellation of satellites.About 7 minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first-stage booster returned to earth and landed on a floating platform on a ship in the Pacific Ocean, while the rocket's second stage continued to carry the satellites toward orbit. A SpaceX Falcon 9 on Friday launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida and boosted a communications satellite for Bulgaria into orbit. Its first stage was recovered after landing on a drone ship in the Atlantic.Billionaire Elon Musk, who founded Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX, believes reusing rocket components will bring down the cost of space launches. Iridium plans to put in place 75 new satellites for its mobile voice and data communications system by mid-2018, requiring six more launches, all by SpaceX.The USD 3 billion effort by the McLean, Virginia, company involves complex procedures to replace 66 operational satellites in use for many years. Some of the new satellites will be so-called on-orbit spares, or older satellites that remain in orbit on standby for use if the newer ones malfunction.Swapping out and deorbiting some old satellites has already begun, Iridium CEO Matt Desch said in a pre-launch call with reporters. Several old satellites have been moved into lower orbits to use up their remaining fuel and configure the solar panels for maximum drag so they will re-enter the atmosphere and burn up. The first re-entry was believed to have occurred on June 11, Desch said.""It's hard to celebrate something like that, but these satellites have put in almost 20 years of service, and making sure we've cleaned up after ourselves as we deploy our new constellation is a priority,"" he said.The new satellites also carry payloads for joint-venture Aerion's space-based, real-time tracking and surveillance of aircraft around the globe, which has implications for efficiency, economy and safety especially in remote airspace over the oceans.""This will truly be a revolutionary aspect of air-traffic control,"" said Aireon CEO Don Thomas.The technology, which requires aircraft to be equipped with certain equipment, is undergoing testing involving eight of the initial batch of Iridium NEXT satellites. The Iridium NEXT program also will bring an end to so- called ""Iridium flares,"" which space enthusiasts have observed for years. The new satellites will not create visible flashes of reflected sunlight as they passed overhead."

Images showed dead bodies in cities like Kharkiv being arranged in the shape of the letter, public school children in Russia forming 'Z' in aerial footage. Russian-backed channel RT, within days of the invasion, announced that it is selling merchandise of the letter, to show support to the Russian troops. The symbol can potentially mean where the Russian troops are stationed, on the lines of Zapad, which means 'west' in Russia.   A huge letter Z, which has become a symbol of the Russian military, is reflected in an office building in a street in Moscow, Russia  Vehicles drive through a street with the letter ZThe symbol can potentially mean where the Russian troops are stationed, on the lines of Zapad, which means 'west' in Russia.  A huge letter Z, which has become a symbol of the Russian military, is reflected in an office building in a street in Moscow, Russia Vehicles drive through a street with the letter ZOn February 19, 2022, five days ahead of the war, Russian tanks and military trucks passed by the Ukrainian border - with the symbol. What started as 'just a sign on military equipment', soon became a denotation. To what - is the question that left experts thinking hard. Slowly, 'Z' has been found in triangles, squares, and circles in and around the victim nation Ukraine. Experts believe that this is to identify from city to city that has been invaded.  There is no letter 'Z' in the Russian script. So what does the marking mean?Initially, there were reports that the symbol means the number 2, which stands for 2.22.2022 - the day Russia ratified an agreement on ""friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance"" with the self-proclaimed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk.Or, it could be just a symbol for Russia's military to identify its forces. Experts have been arguing that the symbol 'Z' is Russian President Vladimir Putin's new 'Swastika'.The symbol can potentially mean where the Russian troops are stationed, on the lines of Zapad, which means 'west' in Russia. News agency BBC quoted an analyst and said, ""Often with propaganda, the simplest things catch on the quickest. "" About Z, ""It looks rather intimidating and quite stark. From an aesthetic perspective, it's a very powerful symbol."" It has taken less than a fortnight for the ""Z"" to spread among those supportive of President Putin's invasion.Russian Defense Ministry, on social media, has been promoting the sign as a meaning 'for' in Russian, a sign of support for the invasion. There are posts about 'V' too, which stands for 'power of truth'. There are written captions. ""Za PatsanoV"" reads one, meaning ""for the lads"" - while another says ""Sila V pravde"", which translates into English as ""strength in truth"".Image Source : BBCImages from the Russian defence ministry's instagramImages from the Russian defence ministry's instagram'Z' does not occur anywhere in the Russian or Ukrainian Cyrillic alphabet. Rather, there is a number '3' that resembles the sounding. Za pobedu (in Russian) could mean victory. Visuals of flashmobs in the country show people wearing 'Z' t-shirts and hoodies. A rather disturbing image also showed terminally ill children in Kazan forming a Z to support the invasion of Ukraine.Soviet-era buildings, advertisment signs, and street art has been smeared with paint, a war sign - 'Z'. In support of the war, Sergei Tsivilev, head of the Kemerovo region, had also announced that he had decided to rename the region and add the letter Z to the region, which might now be listed as KuZbass. Not just in Russia, several Serbs were also seen wearing the merchandise and carrying the Russian flag were seen marching to the Russian embassy in a show of support for the nation. Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak wore a 'Z' symbol at the podium when he received a bronze medal and stood next to a Ukrainian athlete. ALSO READ: Biden wants another $33 billion to help Ukraine battle Russian invasion"

Later on Thursday, two of the world's biggest credit rating agencies also said Sri Lanka had defaulted, the BBC reported.Defaults happen when governments are unable to meet some or all of their debt payments to creditors. It can damage a country's reputation with investors, making it harder to borrow the money it needs on international markets, which can further harm confidence in its currency and economy.Asked on Thursday whether the country was now in default, central bank governor Weerasinghe said: ""Our position is very clear, we said that until they come to the restructure (of our debts), we will not be able to pay. So that's what you call pre-emptive default.""There can be technical definitions... from their side they can consider it a default. Our position is very clear, until there is a debt restructure, we cannot repay,"" he added.An inflation rate spiralling towards 40 per cent, shortages of food, fuel and medicines and rolling power blackouts have led to nationwide protests and a plunging currency, with the government short of the foreign currency reserves it needed to pay for imports.New York-based ratings agency Fitch has downgraded debt-ridden Sri Lanka’s sovereign rating to “restricted default” after the country defaulted on making international sovereign bond payments.On April 12, Fitch had downgraded Sri Lanka to ‘C’.“We have downgraded Sri Lanka’s foreign-currency issue ratings to ‘D’ from ‘C’, given the default on the senior unsecured foreign-currency bonds and the cross-default clauses triggered in the other rated international foreign-currency sovereign bonds,” the rating agency said on Thursday.Sri Lanka has already suspended repayments for international sovereign bonds, commercial bank loans, Exim bank loans, and bilateral loans. However, multilateral lenders and senior creditors were excluded.The debt-ridden country is now negotiating a loan with the IMF.The IMF on Friday said that it remains committed to helping Sri Lanka in line with its policies and is in talks with stakeholders to support a timely resolution of the economic crisis in the country.“There’s currently a virtual IMF staff mission engaged in those technical talks with the Sri Lankan authorities, and we expect that to continue that mission to continue through May 24. So we remain committed to helping Sri Lanka in line with the IMF policies and will engage with stakeholders in support of a timely resolution of the crisis that is being faced there,” International Monetary Fund spokesman Gerry Rice said.Sri Lanka had to pay USD 106.34 million this year but only managed to pay USD 12.4 million by April.In the month of April, the two sides convened their first round of talks at the IMF headquarters in Washington.Sri Lanka is hoping for a Rapid Finance Instrument (RFI) facility as well as a larger Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the international financial body to help it deal with its foreign currency shortages, which have triggered an economic crisis.ALSO READ | As Sri Lanka faces economic crisis, Rahul Gandhi compares it to India, says 'they look alike'In the last meeting, the IMF assured to help the country with an amount of USD 300 million to USD 600 million.Weerasinghe said on Thursday that the nation has announced a pre-emptive default.""What we have announced is a pre-emptive default, we have announced that we are not going to pay,"" he said.Weerasinghe said ""you can technically term it a hard default based on the agreements"".He said that adequate dollars had been released to pay for fuel and cooking gas shipments, helped by USD 130m from the World Bank and remittances in foreign currency sent home by Sri Lankans working overseas, the Guardian newspaper reported.Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said this week that the crisis would get worse in the next couple of months before it could get better.The worst economic crisis has led to the resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister after months of protests that involved violent, fatal clashes on the streets of the capital.The Covid pandemic had triggered a collapse in tourism, leading to a fall in foreign currency income and rising debt levels – a situation made worse by the surge in global commodity prices this spring, exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine.Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. The crisis is caused in part by a lack of foreign currency, which has meant that the country cannot afford to pay for imports of staple foods and fuel, leading to acute shortages and very high prices.At least six people have died due to exhaustion while standing in long queues for essentials. Ten more died from clashes on May 9 when a pro-government group attempted to break up anti-government protesters demanding President Rajapaksa’s resignation for mishandling of the crisis.Last month, the country declared its inability to service its debt amounting to USD 51 billion. In 2022, the foreign debt commitments were at USD 6 billion.India’s economic assistance package since January had kept Sri Lanka afloat in its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. India provided credit lines for the purchase of fuel and essentials as Sri Lanka’s foreign reserves depleted.New Delhi has committed more than USD 3 billion to debt-ridden Sri Lanka in loans, credit lines and credit swaps since January this year.The political crisis was triggered in late March when people hurt by long hours of power cuts and essential shortages took to the streets demanding the resignation of the government.President Rajapaksa sacked his Cabinet and appointed a younger cabinet as a response to the demand for resignation.

Her body was found a week later at at White Rock beach, Wairarapa, North Island.Sonam’s body was found by surfers at White Rock beach. Just days before the body was found, her two mobile phones were recovered from Island Bay beach, following which the police intensified its search operation, a report said.While autopsy has revealed the sex of her foetus, the police have not yet made this information public. All the cops will say at this point is that they have a provisional cause of death, but details will be shared with the family only after investigations, including forensic analysis, are completed, it said.According to reports, husband told police that she was upset after getting ultrasound report, contents of which have not been revealed. Her husband, Sagar Shelar, 32, a chef, has told cops that she was upset after receiving her ultrasound reports.  The local police, however, have not yet said anything about the cause of Sonam’s death, nor have they revealed the contents of the report.

He said he was looking forward to a world where there will be rules and regulations for privacy and data safety like food safety laws and drug safety laws.""One thing I hope for is that we don't fragment, that we are able to, whether it's on privacy or data safety, bring together a set of global rules that will allow all of us to both comply and make sure that what we build is safe to use,"" he said in a virtual interactive session with Telangana's Information Technology and Industry Minister K. T. Rama Rao during Bio Asia 2021.Pointing out that there are regulations all over the world for privacy, he said Europe was the first to come out with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).""It's spreading everywhere. Privacy is a human right. I think it is going to be recognised and there will be other regulations which are going to say that when you use, in healthcare, for example, data, who is benefitting. Ultimately if some patient data is being used, it has to benefit the patient. I think that the value exchange around data, its privacy, or if it is used who is benefiting are all things where there are going to be rules that are going to be legislated. Same thing with facial recognition and same with AI ethics.""Stating that technology is becoming pervasive in people's lives, society, and economy, he underlined the need for companies building tech platforms and tools to ensure the privacy of the user.""We need to take responsibility to ensure we build for privacy, we build for security, we build for AI ethics and we build even for Internet safety because these four things are not things we can wait even for regulation. We have to, even from an engineering and design ethos perspective, build it into our core. We can't afford to say we will build it and we will see what breaks and then fix it, because that attitude is not tolerated in any other industry and it should not be even in the tech industry.""""One of the things we are trying to ensure is how do we have that design principles and engineering processes to ensure that the products and the services are respecting privacy, security, AI ethics as well as the fundamental Internet safety but beyond that, there will be regulation,"" he added.Replying to another question by the minister, Nadella noted that the pandemic has, across the board, accelerated digital transformation.He pointed out how the pandemic and digital response transformed outpatient visit to a hospital, brought workflow innovation around patients and their families, reducing the burden on frontline workers, and giving better tools for physicians so that they can spend more time with the patients.He said the transformation also helped with clinical data for drug discovery. ""I am looking forward to come out of pandemic as a society which is better at handling the next tail event because we can't predict what the next tail event is,"" he added.On a new way of working from home, the Microsoft CEO said it will bring more flexibility in terms of time and worksites.""I think collaboration, learning, and well-being are fundamentally the things that are going to transform how we think about work while giving people more flexibility,"" he said.ALSO READ | Microsoft adding nation-state security alerts for enterprises"
cb725b4796871bfdf8ca4dc4321b5592,"Firefighters search for survivors inside a collapsed building, after Saturday´s 7.2 magnitude earthquake in Les Cayes, Haiti.The death toll from a 7.2-magnitude earthquake in Haiti climbed to 1,297 on Sunday, a day after the powerful temblor turned thousands of structures into rubble and set off franctic rescue efforts ahead of a potential deluge from an approaching storm.Saturday’s earthquake also left at least 5,700 people injured in the Caribbean nation, with thousands more displaced from their destroyed or damaged homes. Survivors in some areas were forced to wait out in the open amid oppressive heat for help from overloaded hospitals.The devastation could soon worsen with the coming of Tropical Depression Grace, which is predicted to reach Haiti on Monday night. The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned that although Grace had weakened from tropical storm strength Sunday, it still posed a threat to bring heavy rain, flooding and landslides.The earthquake struck the southwestern part of the hemisphere’s poorest nation, almost razing some towns and triggering landslides that hampered rescue efforts in a country already struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, a presidential assassination and a wave of gang violence.The epicenter was about 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of the capital of Port-au-Prince, the U.S. Geological Survey said, and aftershocks continued to jolt the area Sunday.In the badly damaged coastal town of Les Cayes, Jennie Auguste lay on a flimsy foam mattress on the tarmac of the community’s tiny airport waiting for anything — space at a hospital or a small plane like the ones ferrying the wounded to the capital. She suffered injuries in the chest, abdomen and arm when the roof collapsed at the store where she worked.“There has been nothing. No help, nothing from the government,” Auguste’s sister, Bertrande, said.ALSO READ | 7.2 magnitude earthquake hits Haiti; death toll reaches 29In scenes widespread across the region hit by the quake, families salvaged their few belongings and spent the night at an open-air football pitch. On Sunday, people lined up to buy what little was available: bananas, avocados and water at a local street market.Some in the town praised God for surviving the earthquake, and many went to the cathedral, which appeared outwardly undamaged even if the priests’ residence was destroyed.“We only have Jesus now,” said Johanne Dorcely, whose house was destroyed. “If it wasn’t for Jesus, I wouldn’t be able to be here today.”Workers tore through rubble of collapsed buildings with heavy machinery, shovels and picks. After sundown, Les Cayes was darkened by intermittent blackouts, and many slept people outside again, clutching small transistor radios tuned to news, terrified of a possible repetition of Saturday’s strong aftershocks.Prime Minister Ariel Henry has declared a one-month state of emergency for the whole country and said he was rushing aid to areas where towns were destroyed and hospitals were overwhelmed.“The first convoys started following the coordination efforts of several ministers mobilized at the level of the National Emergency Center,” Henry told reporters Sunday. “We salute the dignity, the resilience effort of the victims and their ability to start over. From my observations, I deduce that Haitians want to live and progress. Let us unite to offer these people a living environment conducive to development.”UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said Sunday that humanitarian needs are acute, with many Haitians urgently needing health care, clean water and shelter. Children who have been separated from parents need protection, she said.“Little more than a decade on, Haiti is reeling once again,” Fore said in a statement. “And this disaster coincides with political instability, rising gang violence, alarmingly high rates of malnutrition among children, and the COVID-19 pandemic — for which Haiti has received just 500,000 vaccine doses, despite requiring far more.”The country of 11 million people received its first batch of U.S.-donated coronavirus vaccines only last month via a United Nations program for low-income countries.Haiti’s Office of Civil Protection said more than 7,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 5,000 damaged. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches were also affected.Medical workers from across the region were scrambling to help as hospitals in Les Cayes started running out of space to perform surgeries.“Basically, they need everything,” said Dr. Inobert Pierre, a pediatrician with the nonprofit Health Equity International, which oversees St. Boniface Hospital, about two hours from Les Cayes.SEE PICS: Devastating 7.2 magnitude earthquake in Haiti kills dozens | PHOTOS“Many of the patients have open wounds and they have been exposed to not-so-clean elements,” added Pierre, who visited two hospitals in Les Cayes — one with some 200 patients, the other with around 90. “We anticipate a lot of infections.”Pierre’s medical team was taking some patients to St. Boniface to undergo surgery, but with just two ambulances, they could transport only four at a time.Small planes from a private firm and the Florida-based missionary service Agape Flights landed at the Port-Au-Prince airport Sunday carrying about a half dozen injured from the Les Cayes area. Young men with bandages and a woman were hoisted on stretchers to waiting Haitian Red Cross ambulances.Silvestre Plaza Rico, who was supervising one of the volunteer flights, said rescue planes had made several airlifts of about a half dozen injured victims each on Saturday. “There were many, many, many, from different towns,” Plaza Rico said.The earthquake struck just over a month after President Jovenel Moïse was shot to death in his home, sending the country into political chaos. His widow, Martine Moïse, who was seriously wounded in the attack, posted a message on Twitter calling for unity among Haitians: “Let’s put our shoulders together to bring solidarity.”Shortly after the earthquake, Henry said he wanted “structured solidarity” to ensure the response was coordinated to avoid the confusion that followed the devastating 2010 earthquake, when aid was slow to reach residents after.U.S. President Joe Biden named USAID Administrator Samantha Power to oversee the U.S effort to help Haiti. She announced Sunday that USAID was sending a search and rescue team from Virginia at the request of Haiti’s government. The 65-person team will bring specialized tools and medical supplies, she said on Twitter.Working with USAID, the U.S. Coast Guard said a helicopter was transporting medical personnel from the Haitian capital to the quake zone and evacuating the injured back to Port-au-Prince. Lt. Commander Jason Nieman, a spokesman, said another helicopter was being sent from the Bahamas, along with other aircraft and ships.Already on the scene were several members of Cuba’s 253-member health care mission to Haiti, and the socialist nation’s state media showed photos of them giving first aid to victims injured by the quake.The North Carolina-based aid group Samaritan’s Purse announced it would fly 13 disaster response specialists and 31 tons of emergency supplies to Haiti. Those include shelter materials and water filtration units.Humanitarian workers said gang activity in the seaside district of Martissant, just west of the Haitian capital, was complicating relief efforts.The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Haiti’s southern peninsula is a “hotspot for gang-related violence,” where humanitarian workers have been repeatedly attacked.The agency said the area has been “virtually unreachable” over the past two months because of road blocks and security concerns. But it said late Sunday that local officials negotiated with gangs in the seaside district of Martissant to allow two humanitarian convoys a day to pass through the area.Anna Jefferys, spokeswoman for the U.N. agency, said the first convoy passed through Sunday with government and U.N. personnel. The U.N.’s World Food Program plans to send food supplies via trucks to southern Haiti on Tuesday, she added.Haiti, where many live in tenuous circumstances, is vulnerable to earthquakes and hurricanes. A magnitude 5.9 earthquake in 2018 killed more than a dozen people.The magnitude 7.0 quake of 2010 hit closer to densely populated Port-au-Prince and caused widespread destruction. Haiti’s government put the death toll at more than 300,000, while a report commissioned by the U.S. government placed it between 46,000 and 85,000.ALSO READ | Haiti: Death toll from earthquake rises to 700, over 2,800 injured"

1021a5ba1ac227e9919f85568a2999ca,"A helicopter flies over the massive, rain-fueled landslide in the village of Queja, in Guatemala, Saturday, Nov. 7, 2020, in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Eta. A strengthening Tropical Storm Eta made landfall on Florida’s Lower Matecumbe Key on Sunday night, days after leaving scores of dead and over 100 missing in Mexico and Central America. The US National Hurricane Center in Miami declared hurricane and storm surge warnings for the Keys from Ocean Reef to the Dry Tortugas, including Florida Bay.Florida officials closed beaches, ports and COVID testing sites, shut down public transportation and urged residents to stay off the street. Several shelters also opened in Miami and the Florida Keys for residents in mobile homes and low lying areas. Broward County also shut down in-person schooling Monday and Miami seemed poised to do the same.On Sunday night, authorities in Lauderhill, Florida, responded to a report of a car that had driven into a canal. Photos taken by fire units on the scene about 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Miami showed rescuers searching what appeared to be flooded waters near a parking lot.Firefighters pulled one person from a car and took the patient to a hospital in critical condition, according to a statement from Lauderhill Fire’s public information officer. Responders were continuing to search for others.Eta had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph) on Sunday night and was centered about 30 miles (45 kilometers) east-northeast of Marathon, Florida, and 70 miles (115 kilometers) east-northeast of Key West. It was moving west-northwest at 14 mph (22 kph).The storm swelled rivers and flooded coastal zones in Cuba, where 25,000 had been evacuated. But there were no reports of deaths.Eta earlier hit Cuba even as searchers in Guatemala were still digging for people believed buried by a massive, rain-fueled landslide. Authorities on Sunday raised the known death toll there to 27 from 15 and said more than 100 were missing in Guatemala, many of them in the landslide in San Cristobal Verapaz.Some 60,000 people had been evacuated in Guatemala.At least 20 people also were reported dead in southern Mexico and local officials in Honduras reported 21, though the national disaster agency had confirmed only eight.Pope Francis on Sunday spoke about the population of Central America, hit “by a violent hurricane, which has caused many victims and huge damage, worsened as well by the already difficult situation due to the pandemic.” Speaking to faithful gathered in St. Peter’s Square, Francis prayed that “the Lord welcome the deceased, comfort their families and sustain all those so tried, as well as all those who are doing their best to help them.”In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency Saturday for eight counties at the end of the state as Eta approached, urging residents to stock up on supplies. South Florida started emptying ports and a small number of shelters opened in Miami and the Florida Keys for residents in mobile homes and low-lying areas.Miami-Dade County declared a state of emergency Friday night and also warned a flood watch would be in effect through Tuesday night.Further south in the Keys, officials were monitoring the storm closely but had no plans yet to evacuate tourists or residents. They urged residents to secure their boats and encouraged visitors to consider altering plans until Eta had passed.Eta initially hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, and authorities from Panama to Mexico were still surveying the damages following days of torrential rains during the week.In Guatemala, search teams first had to overcome multiple landslides and deep mud just to reach the site where officials have estimated some 150 homes were devastated.In the worst-hit village, Quejá, at least five bodies have been pulled from the mud. The Indigenous community of about 1,200 residents consisted of simple homes of wood and tin roofs clinging to the mountainside.Rescue workers used a helicopter to evacuate survivor Emilio Caal, who said he lost as many as 40 family members and relatives. Caal, 65, suffered a dislocated shoulder when the landslide sent rocks, trees and earth hurtling onto the home where he was about to sit down to lunch with his wife and grandchildren. Caal said he was blown several yards (meters) by the force of the slide, and that none of the others were able to get out.“My wife is dead, my grandchildren are dead,” said Caal from a nearby hospital.Firefighters’ spokesman Ruben Tellez said at least one additional person died in Guatemala on Sunday when a small plane went down while carrying emergency supplies to the stricken area.In neighbouring Honduras, 68-year-old María Elena Mejía Guadron died when the brown waters of the Chamelecon river poured into San Pedro Sula’s Planeta neighbourhood before dawn Thursday.In southern Mexico, across the border from Guatemala, 20 people died as heavy rains attributed to Eta caused mudslides and swelled streams and rivers, according to Chiapas state civil defence official Elías Morales Rodríguez.The worst incident in Mexico occurred in the mountain township of Chenalho, where 10 people were swept away by a rain-swollen stream; their bodies were later found downstream.Flooding in the neighbouring state of Tabasco was so bad that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador cut short a trip to western Mexico and was flying to Tabasco, his home state, to oversee relief efforts.(Except for the headline, Indiatvnews.com has not edited anything in the copy)"
713a92abcc393d6d5e35259f01422e24,"China today asserted its opposition to India’s membership bid to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), saying there is no change in its stand and efforts were on to forge “consensus” among the 48-member elite nuclear club about the admission of new members.  “China’s position on this remains unchanged,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told media here responding to Russian deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov’s remarks in New Delhi yesterday that Moscow was speaking to China for India’s membership into the NSG. “China supports the NSG to follow the principle of consensus through consultation through transparent and fair intergovernmental process to deal with this issue,” Geng said.  China, a key member of the NSG, has been stridently opposing India’s bid primarily on the grounds that New Delhi is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  Its opposition has made India’s entry into the group difficult as the NSG works on the principle of consensus.  China’s repeated stonewalling of India’s membership bid in the NSG has become a major stumbling block in bilateral relations. After India’s application for entry into the elite group which controls nuclear trade, Pakistan, China’s all-weather ally, too had applied with the tacit backing of Beijing.  Pakistan’s application came despite serious allegation of proliferation of nuclear technology by its scientist A Q Khan.  Ryabkov yesterday said that Russia is unwavering in its support to India’s membership of international nuclear control regimes and Moscow was speaking to China in this regard.  Asked for his reaction to Ryabkov’s comments, Geng said all the members of the NSG supported the two-step approach-to find non-discriminatory solution that applies to all non-NPT countries then on that basis discuss the application of the non-NPT counties. He said the focus is on some non-NPT countries who hope to join the group in the capacity of nuclear weapons free countries. “At the same time they will not sign the Comprehensive Safeguard Agreement (CSA) of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)” which is mandatory under the NPT, he said.  “In this circumstance if we agree for the above-mentioned applications, it will have two consequences, that is to recognise the nuclear weapons status of the Non-NPT countries.  Secondly, it will cause other than nuclear weapons free countries to follow suit not to sign CSA with IAEA,” he said.  “This will subvert the NPT and whole international non- proliferation regime,” he added. China suggested that the NSG can pool the wisdom and further explore on this issue and find a solution which can be accepted by all relevant parties and can uphold the international non-proliferation regime with NPT as a cornerstone. “On this we will further discuss application of non-contracting parties,” Geng said. Asked whether the issue will figure in the Russia, India, China (RIC) Foreign Ministers’ meeting to be held in Delhi on December 11, Geng said that the meeting will focus on pragmatic cooperation. At the same time they will exchange views on international issues of common concern."

And it is by far the largest release from our national reserve in our history,"" he said.The revenue generated from selling the oil would be used to restock the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when prices are lower so that the country is ready for future emergencies, he said.  Biden said he has been talking to other allies and partners around the world. ""Already, we have commitments from other countries to release tens of millions of additional barrels into the market. Together, our combined efforts will supply well over a million barrels a day -- nations coming together to deny Putin the ability to weaponize his energy resources against American families, and families and democracies around the world,"" he said.The president also announced plans about declaring real American energy independence in the long term so that the US never has to deal with this problem again. ""Ultimately, we and the whole world need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels altogether.

The unmanned Falcon rocket blasted off from Florida's Kennedy Space Center, as schools and businesses boarded up for Hurricane Irma. It's the fifth flight for one of these crewless mini-shuttles, known as the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle. The two Air Force space planes have already logged a combined 5 years in orbit. But officials won't say what the spacecraft are doing up there. The last mission lasted almost two years and ended with a May touchdown at the runway formerly used by NASA's space shuttles. The first one launched in 2010. As has become customary, SpaceX landed its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral for eventual reuse. This was the first time SpaceX has provided a lift for the experimental mini-shuttle. The previous missions relied on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rockets. Air Force officials said they want to use a variety of rockets for the X-37B programme, to launch quickly if warranted. The Boeing-built mini-shuttle is 29 feet long, with a 14-foot wingspan. By comparison, NASA's retired space shuttles were 122 feet long, with a 78-foot wingspan. SpaceX stopped providing details about the X-37B's climb to orbit, a few minutes after lift-off at the Air Force's request. The booster's return to SpaceX's landing zone at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, however, was broadcast live. ""The Falcon has safely landed,"" a SpaceX launch controller announced. Cheers erupted at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. It was SpaceX's 16th successful return of a first-stage booster. Booster rockets are normally discarded at sea."

The highly contagious COVID-19 coronavirus has impacted on nations around the globe, many imposing self isolation and exercising social distancing when people move from their homes.(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) The global health crisis is taking a nasty political turn with tensions worsening between governments locked down to keep the coronavirus at bay and people yearning to restart stalled economies and forestall fears of a depression. Protesters worrying about their livelihoods and bucking infringements on their freedom have taken to the streets in some places. A few countries are acting to ease restrictions, but most of the world remains unified in insisting it’s much too early to take more aggressive steps.In the United States, there is clear evidence of the mounting pressure. The Trump administration says parts of the country are ready to begin a gradual return to normalcy. Yet some state leaders say their response to the pandemic is hindered by a woefully inadequate federal response.Washington state’s Democratic governor, Jay Inslee, accused President Donald Trump of encouraging insubordination and “illegal activity” by goading protesters who flouted shelter-in-place rules.“To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law, I can’t remember any time during my time in America where we have seen such a thing,” Inslee told ABC’s “This Week.″ He said it was ”dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives.”Trump supporters in several states have ignored social distancing and stay-at-home orders, gathering to demand that governors lift controls on public activity. The largest protest drew thousands to Lansing, Mich., on Wednesday, and others have featured hundreds in several states. The president has invoked their rallying cry, calling on several states with Democratic governors to “LIBERATE.”Vice President Mike Pence sidestepped questions Sunday about why Trump seemed to be encouraging efforts to undermine preventive measures his own government has promoted. Inslee likened Trump’s response to “schizophrenia.” Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, said it “just doesn’t make any sense.”“We’re sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations,” Hogan said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Shutdowns that began in China in late January and spread globally have disrupted economic, social, cultural and religious life and plunged the world into a deep economic slump unseen since the Great Depression. Tens of millions of workers have lost their jobs and millions more fear they’ll be next.With the arc of infection different in every nation and across U.S. states, proposals have differed for coping with the virus that has killed more than 165,000.Restrictions have begun to ease in some places, including Germany, which is still enforcing social distancing rules but on Monday intended to begin allowing some small stores, like those selling furniture and baby goods, to reopen.Authorities in Spain, which had some of Europe’s strictest restrictions and a virus death toll only exceeded by the U.S. and Italy, said children will be allowed to leave their homes beginning April 27. Albania planned to let its mining and oil industries reopen Monday, along with hundreds of businesses including small retailers, food and fish factories, farmers and fishing boats.The death toll in the U.S. climbed past 41,000 with more than 746,000 confirmed infections, while the global case count has passed 2.38 million, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University of national health reports. The European Center for Disease Control said the continent now has more than 1 million confirmed cases and almost 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus.The actual extent of the pandemic is likely to be significantly higher due to mild infections that are missed, limited testing, problems counting the dead and some nations’ desires to underplay the extent of their outbreaks.The International Monetary Fund expects the global economy to contract 3% this year. That’s a far bigger loss than 2009′s 0.1% after the global financial crisis. Still, many governments are resisting pressures to abruptly relax lockdowns.“We must not let down our guard until the last confirmed patient is recovered,” South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in said Sunday.In Britain, which reported 596 more coronavirus-related hospital deaths on Sunday, officials also said they’re not ready to ease efforts to curb the virus’s spread. U.K. minister Michael Gove told the BBC that pubs and restaurants “will be among the last” to leave the lockdown, which is now in place until May 7.France’s health agency urged the public to stick to social distancing measures that have been extended until at least May 11 and Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said people could be required to wear masks on public transportation, and suggested no one plan faraway summer vacations even after that.Trump is pushing to begin easing the U.S. lockdown in some states even before his own May 1 deadline, a plan that health experts and governors from both parties say will require a dramatic increase in testing capacity nationwide. But Pence insisted in television interviews Sunday that the country has “sufficient testing today” for states to begin reopening their economies as part of the initial phases of guidelines that the White House released last week.The Trump administration has repeatedly blamed state leaders for delays, but governors from both parties have been begging the federal government for help securing in-demand testing supplies such as swabs and chemicals known as reagents. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio made a direct appeal to Washington: “We really need help ... to take our capacity up,” he said on NBC’s ”Meet the Press.”California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said his state can’t begin lifting restrictions until it is able to test more people daily. “Right now, we’re not even close as a nation, let alone as a state, to where we should be on testing,” he said.Trump pushed back in a tweet before his scheduled Sunday evening briefing at the White House. “I am right on testing. Governors must be able to step up and get the job done. We will be with you ALL THE WAY!” he wrote.Economic concerns that have increasingly collided with measures to protect public health are now popping up throughout the U.S.Business leaders in Louisiana have slammed New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell for imposing restrictions that they say have unfairly shuttered economic activity outside the city. A full-page ad in “The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate” newspaper on Sunday urged an easing of lockdowns, even as the paper featured nearly nine pages of obituaries in a city hard-hit by the virus.States including Texas and Indiana have announced plans to allow some retail and other activity to resume and some restrictions were either lifted or set to be on beaches in Florida and South Carolina. But in New York, where the daily coronavirus death toll hit its lowest point in more than two weeks on Sunday, officials warn that New York City and the rest of the hard-hit state aren’t ready to ease shutdowns of schools, businesses and gatherings.Geopolitical and religious tensions stretching back centuries have further complicated the global response to the virus. But Jordan’s King Abdullah II said the outbreak has made “partners” out of “our enemies of yesterday, or those that were not friendly countries yesterday — whether we like it or not.”“I think the quicker we as leaders and politicians figure that out, the quicker we can bring this under control,” he told CBS’ “Face the Nation.″"

c00ccc1a8cff89f181dfa895d7913962,"US President Donald Trump is likely to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate change agreement which was a major foreign policy legacy of his predecessor Barack Obama, media reports said today. In a tweet, Trump said he would be announcing his decision on the 2015 Paris climate deal in the next few days.""I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. Make America great again!,"" Trump said. Two major news outlets Axis and CBS News reported that the US President had made a decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change and the administration has been informing world leaders about it. ""Details on just how exactly the US will be withdrawing are still being worked out by a team that includes EPA administrator Scott Pruitt,"" CBS News reported. ""A full, formal withdrawal could take up to three years to execute, unravelling one of former President Barack Obama's major achievements in office to reduce the impacts of climate change,"" it added. The Pruitt team is deciding on whether to initiate a full, formal withdrawal - which could take three years - or exit the underlying United Nations climate change treaty, which would be faster but more extreme, Axis reported. ""Pulling out of Paris is the biggest thing Trump could do to unravel Obama's climate legacy. It sends a combative signal to the rest of the world that America doesn't prioritise climate change and threatens to unravel the ambition of the entire deal,"" it said. According to 'The Hill' newspaper, the move marks a dramatic departure from the Obama administration, which was instrumental in crafting the deal. ""It also makes the US an outlier among the world's nations, nearly all of whom support the climate change accord,"" it said. A day earlier, Trump on return from his maiden overseas trip met with Pruitt. ""One of the topics that they discussed, of course, was the President's upcoming decision on the Paris Climate Accords,"" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters at his daily news conference. This is the subject that the President is spending a great deal of time on, and one that he spoke to the G7 members about during their meetings, he said. ""Ultimately, he wants a fair deal for the American people and he will have an announcement coming on that shortly,"" Spicer said. Meanwhile, influential Republican Senator Ted Cruz yesterday urged the US President to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change. Earlier, a group of 22 Republican Senators including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a letter urged Trump to withdraw from the agreement. (Reopens FGN 59) Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Trump's likely decision to withdraw from the Paris climate deal poses a grave threat to the planet's future. ""President Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord is a stunning abdication of American leadership and a grave threat to our planet's future,"" she said. ""In walking away from this agreement, the President is denying scientific truths, removing safeguards that protect our health and our environment, protecting polluters and their dirty energy agenda, and threatening our national and global security,"" Pelosi said in a statement. The Paris Accord honours the collective moral responsibility to leave future generations with a planet that is clean, healthy and sustainable, she noted. The agreement signed by 195 countries deploys the full force of governments around the world to halt the rise in carbon emissions that cause extreme climate events, including record droughts, horrific famines and devastating floods, in addition to thousands of deaths each year from asthma attacks and other air pollution-related diseases, she said. ""Rejecting the pact also sends a strong message to the marketplace to direct innovative, entrepreneurial investments in the clean energy economy elsewhere,"" Pelosi said. ""The majority of Americans in both parties know that climate change is real, and want clear, decisive action to arrest its dire effects. Democrats will continue to support the strong action of states, cities and the private sector to halt the march of climate change, no matter how destructive and short-sighted the decisions of this Administration continue to be,"" Pelosi said. Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez said not only did the Trump's decision fly in the face of scientific consensus about the impacts of climate change, it also defied the wishes of the business community, international allies, and religious leaders, including the Pope Francis. ""Withdrawing from the Paris agreement would be a global embarrassment and a gross abdication of American leadership. President Trump should know that he can't stop a drought with a wall,"" Perez said. ""He can't ban hurricanes from entering the country. He can't threaten a real storm with a Tweetstorm. He can't dismiss rising tides and temperatures as fake news. And no matter how hard he might try, he can't negotiate with Mother Nature for a better deal,"" he said.(With PTI inputs)"

Chronology of EventsFormer Pakistan President and Military dictator Pervez Musharraf has been sentenced to death in the case of high treason by a special court in Pakistan. The Peshawar High Court pronounced the verdict on Tuesday, December 17. Musharraf has long been out of the country and is not likely to return at the call of this judgement. He has been living in Dubai since the last few years. A case of high treason was filed against Musharraf in 2013 when Nawaz Sharif's PML-N government came back to power in 2013. The two had fallen out in 1999 after Pakistan's disastrous loss to India in the Kargil War.

One such challenge is that of terrorism, extremism and radicalisation and we will continue to fight this scourge together and along with other like-minded countries,"" she said. Swaraj, who arrived here on a two-day visit, said, ""India has been a longstanding and reliable development partner of Bangladesh."" ""Totally, three lines of credit amounting to USD 8 billion have been extended by India to Bangladesh so far. This is by far the largest development assistance that India has extended to any country worldwide,"" she said. India has also been extending grant assistance for small socio-economic projects in Bangladesh. In the past three years alone, 24 such grant projects have been completed which include construction of students' hostels, tube-wells, cultural centres, and orphanages among others. Presently 58 projects, including city development projects in Rajshahi, Khulna and Sylhet, are under implementation, she said. ""India is now supplying 660 MW of much needed power to the Bangladesh people and this figure will double, if not triple, in the foreseeable future. We will work together as founding members of the International Solar Alliance, for which Bangladesh has just confirmed its accession. This alliance is expected to make solar energy ffordable,"" Swaraj said. The two nations have already agreed on the construction of a petroleum products pipeline that will link Siliguri with Parbatipur, for the benefit of the people of northwestern Bangladesh, as a grant in aid project. The setting up of LNG terminal, supply of natural gas by pipeline and investments in the upstream sector are also under consideration, she said. She said restoration of pre-1965 links encompassing road, rail, water and coastal shipping links is being planned to increase connectivity, citing increase in frequency of the Dhaka-Maitri express. The inaugural run with end-to-end Immigration and Customs services for the Maitri Express and the inaugural commercial run of the Kolkata-Khulna Bandhan service are all expected soon, she said. In order to facilitate people-to-people contacts, she said the Indian Mission and Posts in Bangladesh issued 9.76 lakh visas in 2016 and these are expected to grow to about 14 lakh visas in 2017. Swaraj said India will also offer five-year multiple entry visas for Bangladeshi freedom fighters and is planning a scheme for their medical treatment in India. She will also hand over some memorabilia of the 1971 liberation war to Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to be displayed in museums. This is Swaraj's second visit to Bangladesh and comes after the recent trip of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley during which India operationalised a USD 4.5 billion line of credit to Bangladesh to enable implementation of development projects in key areas, including power, railways, roads and shipping. The announcement of the line of credit was made during Hasina's visit to India in April. The development is also seen as India's attempt to counter rising Chinese influence in Bangladesh, where Beijing is trying to make inroads in infrastructure ventures. "

In a letter addressed to Labour Party General Secretary Jennie Formby, the Indian-origin doctor said the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) had kidnapped an Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre in February, 1984 in Birmingham and brutally murdered him after failing to get the release of its founding member Maqbool Bhat from Indian prison.""This organisation also has a long track record of terror offences in India and is designated as a terrorist organisation there,"" he said. Dr Patil noted that the Luton Labour party and its official website is displaying and circulating a letter of endorsement by the JKLF.The letter of endorsement signed by Syed Tahseen Gilani, JKLF President, British Chapter, stated that on behalf of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front, they completely supported the Labour Party in the election on December 12.Dr Patil said, ""I am a strong advocate of peace between India and Pakistan and have a track record of holding many events to bring both the communities closer. I have erected a statue of an Indo-Pakistani philosopher on the bank of River Thames with the support of the Pakistani Muslim community.""I was very disappointed to note that Luton Labour Party is displaying this letter of endorsement from JKLF on the official Facebook and sending this letter from the JKLF to members of the community via social media.""He asked the Labour Party to take remedial measures as a matter of urgency.ALSO READ | At least 14 dead in Mexico gun battle near Texas borderALSO READ | Pak foreign minister Shah Qureshi to visit Lanka"
93eb178f9e46e98cc9b76c7c5f45e25c,"Sushma SwarajIndia Thursday expressed hope that other member states, including the traditional donors, will step in to support the UN agency for Palestinian refugees which is facing serious resource crunch after the US decided not to provide further funding to it.The Trump administration had last month announced that after carefully reviewing the issue it has decided not to make additional contributions to the United Nation Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).""India has supported UNRWA's work since its establishment. UNRWA has been carrying out commendable work for Palestine refugees,"" External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said at the Ministerial Committee of the NAM on Palestine held Wednesday on the sidelines of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly.She said from this year, India has increased its contribution to UNRWA from USD 1.25 million to USD 5 million annually, the country's highest annual voluntary contribution to any of the UN's funds and programmes. ""We hope other member states, including the traditional donors will also step in to support UNRWA at a time when it is faced with a serious resource crunch,"" Swaraj said. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert had announced that the US was no longer willing to shoulder the very disproportionate share of the burden of UNRWA's costs. ""When we made a US contribution of USD 60 million in January, we made it clear that the US was no longer willing to shoulder the very disproportionate share of the burden of UNRWA's costs that we had assumed for many years,"" Nauert had said in a statement on August 31.Swaraj also voiced concern over the deterioration in the security situation in the region, reiterating that a negotiated two-State solution remains the only viable solution to the issue to bring sustainable peace and lasting security. ""Restraint and moderation are required on all sides. The stagnation since the collapse of talks four years ago and the deterioration in the security situation continues to cause serious concern. We hope for an early resumption of talks between Israel and Palestine that can move towards finding out a comprehensive resolution of the issue,"" she said.She said India's continued commitment to the Palestinian cause and earnestness to develop stronger bilateral relations is demonstrated in the successive high level visit in the recent past. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had visited Palestine in a ""historic"" trip. Swaraj told the meeting that India is investing in projects of healthcare, educational infrastructure, women empowerment and a printing press, in addition to other capacity building programmes. India has also set up various bilateral institutional consultation mechanisms including Foreign Office consultations and a Joint Commission, which pursues these partnership projects. Development partnership projects worth around USD 70 million are under implementation during the last five years, including flagship projects like the super-specialty hospital in Beit Sahour and the India-Palestine Technology Park, which was inaugurated last year in Ramallah, she added. Skills and capacity development for the youth and their enhanced engagement, as an investment in a better future, is also one of the focus of India-Palestine partnership, she said. While the number of youth delegates to participate in the youth exchange programme has been doubled this year, India has also substantially enhanced the scholarships made available for Palestinian professionals and students for technical training and higher education from this year, Swaraj said."
23f1d9584d5c6bc5e948870756842b5f,"Nobel laureate Suu Kyi defends Myanmar army in genocide caseNobel Peace Prize winner and former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi denied Wednesday that Myanmar's armed forces committed genocide, telling the United Nation's top court that the mass exodus of Rohingya people from the country she leads was the unfortunate result of a battle with insurgents.The image of the former pro-democracy icon appearing before the International Court of Justice to defend the army that kept her under house arrest for 15 years was striking. Suu Kyi, who as Myanmar's state counselor holds an office similar to prime minister, was awarded the 1991 peace prize in absentia for championing democracy and rights under the nation's then-ruling junta.Myanmar’s accusers have described a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh.Addressing the world court in The Hague in her additional role as Myanmar's foreign minister, Suu Kyi calmly refuted allegations that army personnel killed civilians, raped women and torched houses in 2017.She said the allegations stemmed from “an internal armed conflict started by coordinated and comprehensive armed attacks ... to which Myanmar’s defense services responded. Tragically, this armed conflict led to the exodus of several hundred thousand Muslims.”Rohingya representatives and rights group said they were appalled by Suu Kyi's testimony.“The world will judge their claim of no genocide with evidence,"" said Mohammed Mohibullah, chairman of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights. ""A thief never admits he is a thief, but justice can be delivered through evidence.”The African nation of Gambia brought the legal action against Myanmar on behalf of the 57-country Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Gambia alleges that genocide occurred and is still ongoing.It requested an emergency legal hearing asking the International Court of Justice to take action to stop the violence, including “all measures within its power to prevent all acts that amount to or contribute to the crime of genocide” in Myanmar.Suu Kyi insisted that Gambia provided “an incomplete and misleading factual picture” of what happened in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state, saying developments in one of Myanmar’s poorest regions were “complex and not easy to fathom.”She detailed how the army responded on Aug. 25, 2017 to attacks by insurgents trained by Afghan and Pakistan extremists.Suu Kyi said the armed forces had tried “to reduce collateral damage” during fighting in 12 locations. Conceding that excessive force might have been used and that one helicopter may have killed “non-combatants,” she said Myanmar is investigating what happened and should be allowed to finish its work.“Can there be genocidal intent on the part of a state that actively investigates, prosecutes and punishes soldiers and officers who are accused of wrongdoing?” she asked the court.Rights groups joined Rohingya representatives in slamming the claims Suu Kyi and Myanmar's legal team made in The Hague.George Graham, humanitarian advocacy director at Save the Children, said Suu Kyi's remarks “fly in the face of all the evidence gathered by the U.N., and the testimony our own teams have heard from countless survivors.”“Rohingya families have faced patterns of unimaginable horrors in a campaign of violence. Children and their parents have been systematically killed, maimed and raped,” he said, adding that “the government of Myanmar has failed at every turn to punish those responsible.”Amnesty International’s Nicholas Bequelin, accused Suu Kyi of trying to downplay the severity of crimes committed against the Rohingya and “wouldn’t even refer to them by name or acknowledge the scale of the abuses. Such denials are deliberate, deceitful and dangerous.”“The exodus of more than three quarters of a million people from their homes and country was nothing but the result of an orchestrated campaign of murder, rape and terror,” he said.The U.S., meanwhile, slapped economic sanctions on four Myanmar military officers suspected of human rights violations. It sanctioned Min Aung Hlaing, commander of Myanmar’s armed forces, over allegations of serious rights abuses. Deputy commander Soe Win and two other military leaders, Than Oo and Aung Aung, were also targeted.“There are credible claims of mass-scale rape and other forms of sexual violence committed by soldiers under Min Aung Hlaing’s command,"" a U.S. Treasury statement said Tuesday.The court's hearings are scheduled to end on Thursday, when Myanmar and Gambia will have 90 minutes each to wrap up their cases."
81b68950caa8690a8df3b72b3df6d400,"Pro-democracy activists holding a copy of Apple Daily newspaper and banner protest outside a court in Hong Kong, Saturday, June 19, 2021, to demand to release political prisonersA Hong Kong court ordered the top editor of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily and the head of its parent company held without bail Saturday in the first hearing since their arrest two days ago under the city's national security law. Ryan Law, the chief editor, and Cheung Kim-hung, the CEO of Next Digital, have been charged with collusion with a foreign country to endanger national security in a case widely seen as an attack on press freedom in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.Chief Magistrate Victor So said there was not sufficient grounds to believe they would not violate the security law again and ordered them held at the Lai Chi Kok detention center. He set the next hearing for August 13. Law and Cheung arrived at the court in an unmarked white van with covered windows. A handful of activists held up a banner and copies of the Apple Daily outside before the hearing began.Three others also arrested Thursday — two Apple Daily senior editors and another executive — have not been charged yet and were released on bail late Friday pending further investigation.The Apple Daily has long been one of the most outspoken defenders of civil liberties in Hong Kong. It supported massive protests demanding more democracy in 2019 and has criticized the subsequent crackdown, including the enactment of a national security law last year.The central government in Beijing has defended the legislation and the crackdown on opposition voices as necessary to restore order and stability. The 2019 protests that challenged Beijing's rule often started as peaceful marches during the day but turned into violent clashes between hard-core demonstrators and police at night.Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai is currently serving a 20-month prison sentence after being convicted of playing a role in unauthorized assemblies — rallies and marches that had not received police approval — during the 2019 protests. He has also been charged under the national security law.The latest arrests mark the first time journalists have been targeted under the new law, except for a freelancer who was arrested for pro-democracy activities. Hundreds of police and security agents who raided Apple Daily's office on Thursday also seized 44 hard drives, and authorities froze $2. 3 million of its assets.Police said the arrests were based on more than 30 articles that had appeared in the Apple Daily since the security law took effect and that had called for international sanctions against China and Hong Kong.The security law specifically criminalises colluding with a foreign country, institution, organization or individual to impose sanctions or a blockade against Hong Kong or China. Critics say Beijing is walking back on its promise at the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from Britain that the city could retain its freedoms not seen elsewhere in China for 50 years.The US has imposed sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials over the crackdown and called for the immediate release of the Apple Daily editors and executives.Asked how journalists should avoid getting in trouble, Hong Kong Security Secretary John Lee told a news conference this week that “the answer is simple: Do your journalistic work as freely as you like in accordance with the law provided you do not conspire or have any intention to break the Hong Kong law and certainly not the Hong Kong National Security Law."" "
5504a0901c255b5f9095e1c25624203f,"Jeff Bezos offers NASA $2 bn discount for human lunar lander missionFresh from his trip to the edge of space, Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos has offered NASA a discount of up to $2 billion to give his space company Blue Origin the human lunar landing system (HLS) contract, won by Elon Musks SpaceX earlier this year. Escalating his space war with Musk, Bezos in an open letter to the NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said on Monday that his company would close the US space agency's near-term budgetary shortfall and producing a safe and sustainable lander that will return Americans to the surface of the Moon – this time to stay.""I believe this mission is important. I am honoured to offer these contributions and am grateful to be in a financial position to be able to do so,"" Bezos wrote.Amid protests from Bezos-owned Blue Origin, the US space agency in May suspended work on the $2.9 billion lunar lander contract given to Elon Musk-owned SpaceX.Blue Origin had filed a protest with the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) against NASA for awarding a $2.9 billion contract to SpaceX for landing astronauts on the Moon by 2024.In the letter, Bezos said that ""Blue Origin will bridge the HLS budgetary funding shortfall by waiving all payments in the current and next two government fiscal years up to $2B to get the programme back on track right now"".""This offer is not a deferral but is an outright and permanent waiver of those payments. This offer provides time for government appropriation actions to catch up. Blue Origin will, at its own cost, contribute the development and launch of a pathfinder mission to the low-Earth orbit of the lunar descent element to further retire development and schedule risks,"" Bezos added.Blue Origin will accept a firm, fixed-priced contract for this work, cover any system development cost overruns, and shield NASA from partner cost escalation concerns.The US space agency was expected to pick two lunar lander prototypes (including one of Blue Origin's) but funding cut from US Congress led the agency to select SpaceX over Blue Origin.The third company in the race, Dynetics, also protested NASA's decision to the GAO, which adjudicates bidding disputes.In a 175-page protest, Blue Origin had accused NASA of misjudging several parts of its proposal for its lunar lander called Blue Moon.Musk responded to Blue Origin's protest with a tweet: ""Can't get it up (to orbit) lol"".The contract is part of NASA's Artemis programme, which aims to return astronauts to the moon by 2024 as a stepping stone to the first human mission to Mars.'Best day ever!', says Bezos as he blasts into space on own rocketJeff Bezos blasted into space on July 20, on his rocket company’s first flight with people on board, becoming the second billionaire in just over a week to ride his own spacecraft.The Amazon founder was accompanied by a hand-picked group: his brother, an 18-year-old from the Netherlands and an 82-year-old aviation pioneer from Texas — the youngest and oldest to ever fly in space.“Best day ever!” Bezos said when the capsule touched down on the desert floor in remote West Texas after the 10-minute flight.Image Source : APJuly 20 File Photo: Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket launches carrying passengers Jeff Bezos, brother Mark Bezos, Oliver Daemen and Wally FunkJuly 20 File Photo: Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket launches carrying passengers Jeff Bezos, brother Mark Bezos, Oliver Daemen and Wally FunkNamed after America’s first astronaut, Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket soared on the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, a date chosen by Bezos for its historical significance.

""UNSMIL notes with horror reports on the discovery of at least eight mass graves in past days, the majority of them in Tarhuna,"" the UNSMIL said in a statement on Thursday. ""International law requires that the authorities conduct prompt, effective and transparent investigations into all alleged cases of unlawful deaths.""The UN-backed government accused the rival eastern-based army of committing war crimes in Tarhuna, the city that used to be the main operation centre for the eastern-based army that is located some 90 km south of the capital Tripoli, reports Xinhua news agency. On Wednesday, Interior Minister of the UN-backed government Fathi Bashagha had confirmed the discovery of the mass graves in Tarhuna.But he did not specify the exact number of graves.There was no comment on the development from the east-based army, which has been retreating in recent weeks in its military campaign against the troops of the UN-backed government.Also on Wednesday, the warring sides in the country began engaging in a new round of ceasefire talks, after heavy fighting around the central city of Sirte.The east-based army has been fighting the UN-backed government troops for more than a year aiming to take control of Tripoli and topple the UN-backed government.The fighting has killed and injured hundreds of civilians and displaced more than 150,000 others."

Conducted by the Tourism Institute of the HES-SO Valais, the study released on Friday involved more than 3,500 major tourism stakeholders including restaurants, hotels, ski lifts and tourism organizations, reports Xinhua news agency.Results of the study indicate that Swiss restaurant owners expect their sales to drop by around 95 per cent in April and May, with a loss of at least 4.5 billion CHF in turnover in 2020.Equally massive reductions are expected by the accommodation providers, showed the study, and the cancellation rate at around 80 percent in the hotel industry will lead to a historically low occupancy rate.As a result, one in five entities in the sector could face bankruptcy, with around 30,000 workers in danger of losing their livelihood.Although the hotel industry forecasts a higher filling rate in the summer months as the confinement measures continue to ease and restaurants allowed to reopen as of May 11, in the absence of foreign tourists, the outlook for the summer in the tourism sector still looks bleak, noted the researchers.Tourism is one of the pillar industries in Swiss economy. Figures from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office showed that the sector contributed 47.2 billion CHF in 2018.According to Erik Jakob, head of the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), the relevant departments of the Swiss government are now examining a proposal for a stimulus package worth 40 million CHF to support the tourism sector.""First we have to assure the tourism industry survives (the shock) before we can invest,"" Jakob told a news conference last month, adding that it could take more than 12 months for the industry to recover.So far, the Swiss Confederation has granted the tourism enterprises loans and short-time work unemployment benefits under the general relief plan.Switzerland has so far reported 29,705 coronavirus cases, with 1,754 deaths."

Executive Director of National Institute of Health (NIH), Major General Aamer Ikram, said this during a briefing to the National Assembly (NA) Standing Committee on National Health Services on Tuesday, The Express Tribune reported.“We are going to make a single-dose vaccine for COVID-19. We conducted the clinical trial of Chinese COVID-19 vaccine CanSinoBio in Pakistan,” he said. Later talking to the media, Ikram said Pakistan was among the first countries to take part in the clinical trial of CanSinoBio vaccine.He said Pakistan had requested China to transfer the technology and the raw material for the vaccine is going to arrive this month. “We hope that we will be able to take some measures for preparation of the vaccine by the end of April.“Our team is ready to undertake this task while a Chinese team has also arrived in Pakistan. The Chinese team will oversee our team at the NIH,” he said. Briefing the parliamentary panel, Ikram said the NIH plant, which was closed a few years back, has been made functional again and once the plant is ready, the process for manufacturing the COVID-19 vaccine will begin.“The NIH is going to make its own single-dose vaccine in the near future,” the official said.The NA committee lauded the NIH’s efforts and declared it good news for the nation.Pakistan has so far administered vaccines to 1. 3 million people but still needs to go a long way before its 220 million people will be inoculated."
fafd57186d51fac1e650ca5751e2cb49,"Representational ImageUsing data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite, astronomers have come up with one of the most accurate measurements of mass of the Milky Way galaxy.While previous research dating back several decades provided estimates for our galaxy's mass, ranging between 500 billion to three trillion solar masses, according to the latest measurements, Milky Way weighs about 1.5 trillion solar masses (one solar mass is the mass of our Sun).The measurement includes all the stars and planets, dust and gas, as well as the four-million-solar-mass supermassive black hole at the center. ""We want to know the mass of the Milky Way more accurately so that we can put it into a cosmological context and compare it to simulations of galaxies in the evolving universe,"" said Roeland van der Marel of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland. To weigh the galaxy, the team augmented Gaia measurements for 34 globular clusters out to 65,000 light-years, with Hubble measurements of 12 clusters out to 130,000 light-years that were obtained from images taken over a 10-year period.They also measured the three-dimensional movement of globular star clusters - isolated spherical islands each containing hundreds of thousands of stars each that orbit the center of our galaxy.The more massive a galaxy, the faster its globular clusters move under the pull of gravity, according to a forthcoming paper in The Astrophysical Journal. The new mass estimate puts our galaxy on the beefier side, compared to other galaxies in the universe. The lightest galaxies are around a billion solar masses, while the heaviest are 30 trillion, or 30,000 times more massive. The Milky Way, the galaxy which contains Earth's solar system, is home to up to 400 billion stars and an estimated 100 billion planets."

7612c9fa62bb5b2be0554d82eeaeab13,"Italian marines accused of killing Indian fishermenAn international arbitration court Monday began hearing into Italy's request to direct India to drop all criminal prosecution against two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen off the Kerala coast in 2012 and grant Rome jurisdiction in the case.Italy took the issue to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2015, saying the case should be tried under maritime law as the incident happened in international waters. India, however, insists that the accused should return to New Delhi for a final judgement by an Indian court. Currently, the two marines - Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone - are in Italy.Italy's representative Francesco Azzarello told the court on Monday that Rome should have jurisdiction over the case because the two marines were functionaries of the Italian state doing their duty on board an Italian flagged ship in international waters.Azzarello told the court that India already considers the marines guilty.""In India's eyes there is no presumption of innocence: the marines were guilty of murder even before the charges were laid,"" he was quoted as telling the court by Italian news agency ANSA.He also said, ""there were unjustifiable postponements of the trial in India. Special procedures were invented in violation of the Indian Constitution.""In response, India's representative G Balasubramanian told the court, ""Italy maintains it has the exclusive jurisdiction in the case but one must take into account the fact that India and the two fishermen are the victims in this case.""He said two fishermen aboard an Indian boat were killed by individuals who were on a merchant ship.On Italy's claims that the marines fired warning shots into the water to deter the boat, he said, ""it is difficult to believe that these volleys were simply meant as warning shots...They hit two crew members, caused damage to the boat, endangering its safe navigation, and also endangering the lives of the other nine crew members.""On Italy's allegations of delay in the Indian court proceedings, he said, ""...the reality of the fact forces me to say that had Italy cooperated with the prosecution of the killing incident, this case would have been finally concluded long ago.""He said Italy initially joined the proceedings before the Indian courts but surprisingly in a negative way, hampered them by filing multiple interlocutory applications challenging the actions of the Indian authorities.""The case proceeded in the Indian courts, first before the Kerala court and then before the Supreme Court followed by the establishment of a special court for that purpose.""Adopting a negative posture, however, Italy chose the cause of delaying it further by filing continuous applications which are nothing but designed to thwart the special court...,"" the Indian representative told the court.He recalled that Girone was allowed to reside at the residence of the Italian ambassador in New Delhi and said, ""This clearly articulates how reasonable and cooperative India has been treating the marines and Italy during the proceedings before the Indian courts.""The marines were aboard the Italian-flagged commercial oil tanker 'Enrica Lexie' when they killed the two Indian fishermen.The complaint against them was lodged by Freddy, the owner of fishing boat 'St Antony' in which the two Kerala fishermen were killed when the marines opened fire on them allegedly under the misconception that they were pirates.Latorre, who had suffered a brain stroke on August 31, 2014, was first granted bail and allowed by the Supreme Court on September 12, 2014 to go to Italy for four months and after that, extensions have been granted to him.In Italy, Latorre had to undergo a heart surgery after which the top court had granted him extension of his stay in his native country.On September 28, 2016, the apex court had allowed Latorre to remain in his country till the international arbitral tribunal decided the jurisdictional issue.On May 26, 2016, Girone was also granted bail and allowed by the Supreme Court to go to his country till the jurisdictional issue was decided. Also Read | India, Pakistan failed to improve situation in Kashmir: United NationWatch | Italian Pilot dies as airshow stunt goes wrong in Italy   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

091b6b41375c0de75600257c35c2edff,"Canadian PM says working with US to stop smuggling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that his government was doing all it can and working “very closely” with the US to stop human smuggling, a day after a family of four Indians, including a baby, died from exposure to extreme cold weather on the Canadian side of the border with America. Terming the incident as a ""mind blowing"" tragedy, Trudeau on Friday said that the Canadian government is doing all it can to stop people-smuggling across the US border.“It was an absolutely mind-blowing story. It’s so tragic to see a family die like that, victims of human traffickers… and of people who took advantage of their desire to build a better life,” Trudeau told a news conference. “This is why we are doing all we can to discourage people from crossing the border in an irregular or illicit manner. We know there are great risks in doing so,” he said.The prime minister said that Canada was working very closely with the United States to stop smuggling and help people “taking unacceptable risks”. According to Canadian officials, the incident was unusual as illegal migrants generally try to cross into Canada from America, rather than the other way round. Border crossings into Canada on foot increased in 2016 following the election of Donald Trump as the president of the United States.On Thursday, the Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said that the bodies of four people — two adults, a teen and an infant — were found on the Canadian side of the US/Canada border near the Emerson locality in south central Manitoba on Wednesday. The family, believed to be Gujaratis, died from the exposure to extreme cold weather.Confirming the nationality of the deceased, India's High Commissioner to Canada Ajay Bisaria described the incident as a grave tragedy.  ""This is a grave tragedy. An Indian consular team is travelling today from @IndiainToronto to Manitoba to coordinate and help. We will work with Canadian authorities to investigate these disturbing events,"" Bisaria tweeted.According to the criminal complaint filed in a court in the US state of Minnesota, all the foreign nationals found on the US side, part of the larger group, spoke in Gujarati. Manitoba RCMP was notified by US Customs and Border Protection on Wednesday morning that a group of people had crossed into the US near Emerson, and that one of the adults was carrying items intended for a baby, but there was no infant with the group.An immediate search began on both sides of the border, and by that afternoon, the bodies of an adult man, an adult woman, and an infant were found. The body of a boy believed to be in his mid-teens was found shortly afterwards. The US Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota said in a press release that 47-year-old Steve Shand of Florida has been arrested.A criminal complaint has been filed on Thursday in the US District Court for the District of Minnesota against Shand, who has been charged with human smuggling. Shand, a ""suspected smuggler of undocumented foreign nationals”, was arrested near the US/Canadian border on January 19 for transporting two Indian nationals, who were illegally present in the US. The two Indian nationals have been identified as ‘SP’ and ‘YP’ in the complaint.The complaint said that five Indian nationals “illegally present in the United States were also identified and arrested” around the time of Shand’s arrest. Inside the vehicle, US officers found cases of plastic cups, bottled water, bottled juice and snacks in the van. As the officers were taking the trio back to the border patrol station in North Dakota, they came across another group of five Indian nationals walking.They said they had walked across the border and had expected to be picked up by someone. The group said they estimated they had been walking for more than 11 hours. One person in the group had a backpack he told officials he was carrying for a family of four they had become separated from that contained children’s items such as clothes, a diaper and a toy.The bodies found on the Canadian side of the border have been tentatively identified as that family of four, the release from the US Attorney’s Office said. Soon after the discovery of the four bodies on the Canadian side of the border, RCMP Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy called it ""an absolute and heartbreaking tragedy"". ""At this very early stage of the investigation, it appears that they all died due to exposure to the cold weather,"" MacLatchy said, adding that the RCMP believe the four people are connected to the group that was apprehended on the US side of the border.She said all four were located within 9-12 metres of the border. MacLatchy said that the group was ""on their own in the middle of a blizzard"" and ""faced not only the cold weather but endless fields, large snowdrifts and complete darkness"". Canadian police said the conditions where the four bodies were extreme and the temperature was 35 below zero degrees with a wind chill. MacLatchy said work is underway to identify the victims, but at this stage, it appears they all died from exposure to the cold.The RCMP said it is working with US Customs and Border Protection and the US Department of Homeland Security. In a statement, the Canada Border Services Agency said it is also working with law enforcement partners, as well as its American counterparts, on the investigation.The office of the Minister of Public Safety said in a statement: “We are shocked and saddened by the tragic deaths of four people attempting to cross the Canada-US border, near Emerson, Manitoba. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to their loved ones, and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.” Also Read | Investigations going on in death of four Indians, smuggling operationAlso Read | Four Indians freeze to death along US-Canada, EAM Jaishankar dials envoys"

(Democratic National Convention via AP)Speaking at the first night of Democratic National Convention from Albany, New York Mayor Gov. Andrew Cuomo tore into President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis and blamed it for worsening situation. Taking on Trump, Cumo blamed him for the division in society. ""Only a strong body can fight off the virus. And America's divisions weakened it. Donald Trump didn't create the initial division, the division created Trump. He only made it worse,"" Cuomo said while slamming Trump for his ignorant attitude towards the pandemic. Cuomo's speech was widely received by the democrats and people who were critical of Trump's handling of the situation. ""Our collective strength is exercised through the government. It is, in effect, our immune system and our current federal government is dysfunctional and incompetent,"" Cumo said. ""It couldn't fight off the virus. In fact, it didn't even see it coming. The European virus infected the Northeast while the White House was still fixated on China. The virus had been attacking us for months before they even knew it was here. We saw the failure of a government that tried to deny the virus, then tried to ignore it and then tried to politicize it,"" Cumo said during his fiery DNC speech. ""We climbed the impossible mountain, and right now we are on the other side. We did it with the kindness and assistance of so many. New Yorkers want to thank everyone who came to our aid -- thirty thousand Americans who volunteered to come here to help in our hour of need,"" he said.Man-made threatGovernor Cuomo called the coronavirus situation a ""man made threat"". ""And we now face a second threat, but this time not from Mother Nature. This is a man made threat by our own negligence. We now see the virus ricocheting across the country from one state to another. Today, we trail the world in defeating COVID. We have over five million cases.

Twitter announced Monday, May 11, 2020, it will warn users with a label when a tweet contains disputed or misleading information about the coronavirus. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)Amid the rising number of cases, social media giant Twitter announced on Monday that it will start alerting users when a tweet makes disputed or misleading claims about the coronavirus. The new rule is the latest in a wave of stricter policies that tech companies are rolling out to confront an outbreak of virus-related misinformation on their sites. Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have already put similar systems in place.The announcement signals that Twitter is taking its role in amplifying misinformation more seriously. But how the platform enforces its new policy will be the real test, with company leaders already tamping down expectations.Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of site integrity, acknowledged as much: “We will not be able to take enforcement action on every tweet with incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19.”Roth said Monday the platform has historically applied a “lighter touch” when enforcing similar policies on misleading tweets but said the company is working to improve the technology around the labels.In February, Twitter said it would add warning labels to doctored or manipulated photos and videos after a recording of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slowed down to make it appear as though she slurred her words. But even with obviously fake videos, such as one showing Joe Biden lolling his tongue and grinning that was shared by President Donald Trump, the company has since used the label only twice, in part because of technical glitches.And Twitter has not added any warning labels to politicians’ tweets that violate its policies but are deemed in the “public interest” under a policy the company announced in June 2019.Under the newest COVID-19 rules, Twitter will decide which tweets are labeled — only taking down posts if they are harmful.Politicians’ tweets will be subject to the notices, which will be available in roughly 40 languages.Some of the questionable tweets will run with a label underneath that directs users to a link with additional information about COVID-19. Other tweets might be covered entirely by a warning label alerting users that “some or all of the content shared in this tweet conflict with guidance from public health experts regarding COVID-19.”Twitter won’t directly fact check or call tweets false on the site, said Nick Pickles, the company’s global senior strategist for public policy. The warning labels might send users to curated tweets, public health websites or news articles.“People don’t want us to play the role of deciding for them what’s true and what’s not true but they do want people to play a much stronger role providing context,” Pickles said.The notices, which could start appearing as soon as today, could also apply retroactively to past tweets.The fine line is similar to one taken by tech rival Facebook, which has said it doesn’t want to be an “arbiter of the truth” but has arranged for third-party fact checkers to review falsehoods on its site. The Associated Press is part of Facebook’s fact-checking program.One example of a disputed tweet that might be labeled on its site includes claims about the origin of COVID-19, which remains unknown. Conspiracy theories about how the virus started and if it is man-made have swirled around social media for months.Twitter will continue to take down COVID-19 tweets that pose a threat to the safety of a person or group, along with attempts to incite mass violence or widespread civil unrest. The company has been removing bogus coronavirus cures and claims that social distancing or face masks do not curb the virus’ spread for several weeks.(With inputs from AP)"

79bfcd60aadd73c557916540145365cd,"Democrats aren’t buying Trump’s shutdown-ending ‘compromise’In a bid to break the shutdown stalemate, President Donald Trump offered to extend temporary protections for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children and those fleeing disaster zones in exchange for his long-promised border wall. But while Trump cast the move as a “common-sense compromise,” Democrats were quick to dismiss it as a “non-starter.”With polls showing a majority of Americans blaming him and Republicans for the impasse, Trump said from the White House that he was there “to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis on the southern border.”Hoping to put pressure on Democrats, the White House billed the announcement as a major step forward. But Trump did not budge on his $5.7 billion demand for the wall and, in essence, offered to temporarily roll-back some of his own hawkish immigration actions — actions that have been blocked by federal courts.Following a week marked by his pointed clashes with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, it was not clear if Trump’s offer would lead to serious steps to reopen the government, shut for a record 29 days. Trump’s move came as hundreds of thousands of federal workers go without paychecks, with many enduring financial hardship. Many public services are unavailable to Americans during the closure.Democrats dismissed Trump’s proposal even before his formal remarks. Pelosi said the expected offer was nothing more than “a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives” and that the effort could not pass the House“What is original in the President’s proposal is not good. What is good in the proposal is not original,” she later tweeted.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also panned the proposal as “more hostage taking,” saying that it was Trump who had “single-handedly” imperiled the future of the immigrants he proposed to help.The New York Democrat said there is only “one way out” of the shutdown. “Open up the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions.” he said.Democrats had made their own move late Friday to try to break the impasse when they pledged to provide hundreds of millions of dollars more for border security. But Trump, who has yet to acknowledge that offer, laid out his own plan, which officials said had been in the works for days.Seeking to cast the plan as a bipartisan way forward, Trump said Saturday he was incorporating ideas from “rank-and-file” Democrats, as top Democrats made clear they had not been consulted. He also said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would bring the legislation to a vote this week, though Democrats appeared likely to block it. McConnell had previously stated that no vote should be held in the Senate until Trump and Democrats agreed on a bill.Trump’s plan seems to stand little chance of getting the 60 votes needed in the Senate. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat the White House has looked to as a possible partner on immigration negotiations, said he will not support it. And Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, another key centrist, said she would study the details of the plan but did not commit to vote for it.She added of the shutdown: “This needs to end now.”Trump’s remarks from the Diplomatic Room marked the second time he has addressed the nation as the partial shutdown drags on. On this occasion, he sought to strike a diplomatic tone, emphasizing the need to work across the aisle. He maintained a border barrier was needed to block what he describes as the flow of drugs and crime into the country — but described “steel barriers in high-priority locations” instead of “a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.”The proposal was met with immediate criticism from some conservative corners, including NumbersUSA, which seeks to reduce both legal and illegal immigration to the U.S. “The offer the President announced today is a loser for the forgotten American workers who were central to his campaign promises,” said Roy Beck, the group’s president.At the other end of the political spectrum, Trump’s offer was panned by progressive groups, with Anthony Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, calling it a “one-sided proposal.”Trump embraced the shutdown in December in large part because of angry warnings from his most ardent supporters that he was passing up on his last, best shot to build the wall before Democrat took control of the House in the new year. After his announcement Saturday, some supporters appeared unhappy with his effort to bridge the divide with Democrats.“Trump proposes amnesty,” tweeted conservative firebrand Ann Coulter. “We voted for Trump and got Jeb!” she said, in a reference to Trump’s 2016 rival, Jeb Bush.In a briefing with reporters, Vice President Mike Pence defended the proposal from criticism from the right. “This is not an amnesty bill,” he insisted.White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney also sought to increase the pressure on congressional Democrats in advance of Tuesday, the deadline for the next federal pay period and the day officials said McConnell would begin to move on legislation.“If the bill is filibustered on Tuesday...people will not get paid,” he said.Mulvaney said that Trump had not ruled out one day declaring a national emergency to circumvent Congress to get his wall money — as he has threatened — but added that Trump maintains that the “best way to fix this is through legislation.”Trump’s son-in-law and senior aide, Jared Kushner, along with Vice President Mike Pence, had led the efforts build the plan Trump announced on Saturday, according to three people familiar with White House thinking who were not authorized to speak publicly. After a heated meeting with Pelosi and Schumer that Trump stormed out of, the president directed his aides to bypass Democratic leaders and instead reach out to rank-and-file members for ideas.To ensure wall funding, Trump said he would extend temporary protections for three years for “Dreamers,” young people brought to the country illegally as children. Administration officials said the protections would apply only to the approximately 700,000 people currently enrolled in the Obama-era program shielding them from deportation, and not all those who could be eligible. The plan would offer no pathway to citizenship for those immigrants — a deal breaker for many Democrats.Trump also proposed a three-year extension to the temporary protected status the U.S. offers to immigrants fleeing countries affected by natural disasters or violence. Officials said the exemption would apply to about 300,000 people who currently live in the U.S. under the program and have been here since 2011. That means people from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti — countries that saw the status revoked since Trump took office — would get a reprieve.Democrats, however, criticized Trump’s proposal for failing to offer a permanent solution for the immigrants in question and because he refuses back away from his demand a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which the party strongly oppposes. Democrats have told Trump he must reopen government before talks can start.Trump had repeatedly dismissed the idea of a deal involving Dreamers in recent weeks, saying he would prefer to see first whether the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, survived a court challenge.On Friday, the Supreme Court took no action on the Trump administration’s request to decide by early summer whether Trump’s bid to end that program was legal, meaning it probably will survive at least another year.But during a recent trip to the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump hinted at the possibility, saying he would consider working on the wall and DACA “simultaneously.”A previous attempt to reach a compromise that addressed the status of “Dreamers” broke down a year ago as a result of escalating White House demands."

The agreement, which was signed during the December 2019 2+2 Dialogue, will also ease the process of doing business, including applying for licences to support mutual interests, said Vice President (Strategy and Business Development) at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Vivek Lall.In Washington DC this week to attend the farewell of outgoing Indian Ambassador to the US Harsh Vardhan Shringla, Lall will be heading to New Delhi to speak at the Raisina Dialogue.ISA ""represents a historic progression"" between India and the US, he told PTI in an interview on Wednesday. ""This agreement will facilitate close technology transfer with private industry in India and ease the process of doing business including applying for licenses to support mutual interests, Make in India, increased industrial and defense cooperation, and regional stability,"" Lall said.Lockheed Martin has proposed to move its entire F-16 manufacturing base to India, if it gets a critical mass order for the fighter jets that India is planning to acquire for its defence forces. ""To further our relationships, the ISA will enable high-end technologies and defence collaboration to be shared amongst the industry to further leverage Indian industry capabilities and indigenise future R&D and production activities to support mutual US-India interests, he said. The signing of ISA will provide additional benefits for securing data in the manufacture of defence platforms, Lall said.He said the US defence industry is very encouraged by the positive trend being seen in relations between the two countries, including on the defense-industrial partnership front. The Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative and India's designation as a major defence partner of the US are two historic milestones that signal how important both countries are to one another, he said.The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), INDOPACOM and Major Defense Partner status, End-Use Monitoring Agreement, Industrial Security Agreement (ISA), and Tiger Triumph, a major joint military exercise, elevates India's emergence as a stronger strategic partner and represent foundational agreements and exercises that will further future US-India bilateral, industrial and military cooperation, Lall said.Noting that the Indo-Pacific region is indeed a top priority of the current US administration, and New Delhi is a central player in its strategy, he said India, the world's largest democracy, shares common values with the US. Numerous countries in the Indo-Pacific region are recapitalizing their fighter aircraft fleets, including Taiwan. The recent signing of the LoA for 66 F-16 Block 70 F-16 aircraft will further increase US-Taiwan cooperation and stability within the region, the Lokheed Martibn official said.Regarding Japan, ""we look forward to constructive dialogue between the US Government and the government of Japan as they approach a decision on the path ahead for their Future Fighter"", he said adding that Lockheed Martin continues to leverage technologies across its portfolio and the F-21 is no different. ""We believe, the F-21 is the best solution to meet the Indian Air Force's capability needs, provide Make in India industrial opportunities, and accelerate India-US cooperation on advanced technologies,"" said the Lockheed official.""No other company has the experience in next-generation technologies, including but not limited to fighter aircraft, Lockheed Martin can offer to India. We designed, developed and produced the world's first operational stealth aircraft, the F-117, and the world's only two current operational 5th Generation fighters: the F-22 and F-35,"" he asserted.Lall said the F-21 delivers an advanced single-engine, multi-role fighter at the most optimal Life Cycle Cost for the Indian Air Force, with the longest service life of any competitor till 12,000 flight hours.The F-21 goes further, faster, and stays longer than the competition, he said asserting that the F-21 will meet all of India's performance, capability and advanced technology requirements, and provide unmatched opportunities for Indian companies of all sizes and suppliers throughout India. ""The F-21, in concert with the Rafale and Tejas, will provide an operational gap filler and will be a game-changer for the Indian Air Force, Indian industry, and India-US strategic ties"",Lall said. "

Colin Payne, 61, was found guilty of murdering 54-year-old Mark Bloomfield in July last year at Swansea Crown Court in Wales this week.The court heard that Payne, a martial arts expert, had launched an attack on Bloomfield to ""teach him a lesson"" after he had brushed his girlfriend's back with a beer can at a pub in Swansea.""Mark Bloomfield built a legacy that will continue to live on in the countless lives that he encountered. As special assistant to Mother Teresa in Calcutta, he was an essential contributor to her mission and to those she cared for,"" read a family's tribute statement.""In India, he organised free cataract surgery camps and founded schools that gave rare access to education for girls. In Africa, he helped preserve wild game by introducing ultralight aircraft to combat the onslaught of poachers,"" it noted.According to 'The Daily Telegraph', during his time with Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta, now Kolkata, Bloomfield helped people who were terminally ill have dignified deaths. He later went on to work with the nuns to open schools for girls in different parts of India.""All that Bloomfield did that day in the Full Moon (pub) was to touch your girlfriend's back momentarily with a beer can. That cost him his life,"" Judge Paul Thomas said in court on Thursday.""You wanted to show regulars you were not a man who would be trifled with. You had an image to protect as self-styled hard man. You are a man in his sixties who resorts to great violence for slightest provocations and to cement your rep [reputation],"" he said.Payne had pleaded guilty to lesser charges of perverting the course of justice and manslaughter claiming self-defence, but was instead found guilty of murder following the trial.The court was told how he dragged Bloomfield to the floor by his throat and kicked him in his head, before taking the attack outside and punching ""two expert blows"" to his head.Bloomfield was knocked to the ground after hitting his head on the concrete, never to regain consciousness, and died in hospital two days later.ALSO READ | Boris Johnson on the backfoot ahead of final UK election TV debateALSO READ | Shootout at US Navy Florida Base: Shooter killed, another dead, 11 hurt"
c245ce3ce27a434d357ee68db562b7d2,"US House passes bill on sanctions against Chinese officials for meddling in Dalai Lama's successionThe US House of Representatives has passed a bill that authorises financial and travel sanctions against Chinese officials who interfere in the process of selecting the successor to the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet. Introduced by Congressman James P McGovern, Chairman of the House Rules Committee and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, the bill was passed by an overwhelming vote of 392 to 22.The bill, if passed by the Senate and signed into law by the president, will also prohibit China from opening any new consulate in the US until Beijing allows Washington to open its diplomatic station in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.According to the bill, the succession or reincarnation of Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including a future 15th Dalai Lama, is an exclusively religious matter that should be decided solely by the Tibetan Buddhist community.Under the draft legislation, Washington would freeze any American asset and ban US travel of Chinese officials if they are found to be involved in ""identifying or installing"" a Dalai Lama approved by Beijing.Addressing the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the bill sends Beijing a clear signal that it will be held accountable for interfering in Tibet's religious and cultural affairs. The proposed legislation, she said, makes it clear that ""Chinese officials who meddle in the process of recognising a new Dalai Lama will be subject to targeted sanctions, including those in the Global Magnitsky Act"".The Global Magnitsky Act allows the US to sanction foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses anywhere in the world.Pelosi said the bill deploys America's diplomatic weight to encourage a genuine dialogue between Tibetan leaders and Beijing.""It is unacceptable that the Chinese government still refuses to enter into a dialogue with Tibetan leaders...We are supporting the Tibetan people's right to religious freedom and genuine autonomy by formally establishing as US policy that the Tibetan Buddhist community has the exclusive right to choose its religious leaders, including a future 15th Dalai Lama,"" she said.Though introduced as a stand-alone piece of legislation, the bill serves as an amendment to the Tibet Policy Act of 2002, which codified the US position of support for the Tibetan people.""Our bill updates and strengthens the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 to address the challenges facing the Tibetan people. But perhaps as importantly, it reaffirms America's commitment to the idea that human rights matter. That we care about those who are oppressed, and we stand with those who are struggling for freedom,"" Congressman McGovern said on the House floor.""It should be clear that we support a positive and productive US-China relationship, but it is essential that the human rights of all the people of China are respected by their government,"" he asserted.Last year, the US Congress passed the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, demanding that American journalists, diplomats and tourists be given the same freedom to travel to Tibet that Chinese officials have to travel freely in the US.""The Dalai Lama should be commended for his decision to devolve political authority to elected leaders. The Tibetan exile community is also to be commended for adopting a system of self-governance with democratic institutions to choose their own leaders, including holding multiple 'free and fair' elections to select its Parliament and chief executive,"" McGovern said.The bill also mandates the US State Department to begin collaborative and multinational efforts to protect the environment and water resources of the Tibetan Plateau.""We are protecting Tibet's environmental and cultural rights: working with international governments and the business community to ensure the self-sufficiency of the Tibetan people and protect the environment and water resources on the Tibetan Plateau.

However, despite the call for relocation of the project, its construction has continued without any assessment of its impact on the Sundarbans’ World Heritage values, the Union said.Two additional coal-fired power plants are being constructed on the Payra River, which flows into the same bay as the Sundarbans, the website reported the IUCN as saying. Over 150 industrial projects are also active upstream of the site, and their associated shipping and dredging activities further threaten its hydrological and ecological dynamics, it said.“The hydrological systems, which drive this dynamics, are very large in scale and vulnerable to upstream impacts,” the report said.

The Everyone's Invited site was created last year by 22-year-old Soma Sara for students to anonymously report “misogyny, harassment, abuse and assault.”More than 5,800 accounts have been posted, and the site has sparked a public debate that has been called a “Me Too” moment for Britain's schools.The Metropolitan Police force said Saturday it was reviewing the site “to establish whether any victims of crime in London could be encouraged to report crimes to the police.”The force said it had “received a number of reports of specific offenses” related to accounts put on the website.Many of the allegations have dealt with private schools, including some of the country's most elite educational institutions.Detective Superintendent Mel Laremore, Scotland Yard's lead officer for rape and sexual offenses, said that could be because state-run schools worked with the police force in a formal “safer schools network.”“There isn't a safer schools network within the private schools,” she told the BBC. At the same time, Laremore said she thinks the problem is “more widespread than private schools.”She said more than 100 schools across Britain were cited on the website.“We take all allegations of sexual assault very seriously,” Laremore said.“We understand the complex and varied reasons why many victim-survivors do not contact law enforcement, but I want to personally reassure anyone who needs our help that we are absolutely here for you.”Students at Highgate School, a 456-year-old north London institution that charges fees of 21,600 pounds ($30,000) a year, staged a classroom walkout this week.

Also, a girls' school located in Qila Abdullah in Balochistan Province was damaged in an IED attack.Guterres said he is ""concerned"" by the continued attacks on schools by armed groups, particularly the targeting of girls' education. He called on the Pakistan government to prioritise measures to deter future attacks on schools.In Afghanistan, there were 3,179 verified cases of children being killed and maimed in 2017 in the conflict-related violence. An increase in child casualties resulting from aerial operations remained a concerning trend, with 27 child casualties resulting from cross-border shelling out of Pakistan.With reports of over 21,000 violations committed against children in 2017, Guterres expressed outrage over the rise in the number of children affected by fighting globally.""Boys and girls have once again been overly impacted by protracted and new violent crisis.  Despite some progress, the level of violations remains unacceptable,"" he said in a statement.The UN Chief reiterated that the best way to address this horrific situation is to promote peaceful solutions to conflicts and called on all parties to exert maximum efforts in this regard.The UN's expert on Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba, said 66 parties to conflict are listed this year - three more than in the 2016 report - with nine government forces and 57 armed groups being named.""Among the most significant violations registered in 2017 were killing and maiming, recruitment and use and attacks on schools and hospitals, all of which registered a rise in comparison to the previous year,"" she told reporters here.Also worrying is the number of children detained for their alleged association with armed groups, she said, adding such as, over 1,000 children in Iraq are held for their suspected affiliation with the Islamic State terror group.She also said there were some positive developments, like release of over 10,000 child soldiers from armed groups and forces. "
45f3614a67c65dc7bc4c83acc66f0588,"Chinese lab claims patent for US drug to treat coronavirus patientsA research institute in China's virus-hit Wuhan city has applied for a patent on the use of a drug made in the US after it was found to be effective in treating patients infected with the coronavirus, raising questions whether the lab's move violated the intellectual property rights.As the coronavirus strain officially named as 2019 n-CoV wreaked havoc in China and abroad, there is a race to develop a viable medicine to treat an increasing number of cases as well as a vaccine to prevent its spread. In a breakthrough of sorts, US doctors treating a coronavirus patient early this month reported his successful recovery after treating with experimental antiviral drug Remdesivir.This prompted China to announce immediate field trials to test the drug. China's National Health Commission on Monday said the drug trials were being carried out at multiple hospitals in Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak.Some 270 patients will take part in the study, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted China's thepaper.cn as reporting on February 3. Later, state-run Xinhua news agency reported quoting the Ministry of Science and Technology that a batch of antiviral drug Remdesivir, which will be put into clinical trials to test its efficiency on the coronavirus patients, is expected to arrive in China on Tuesday. Remdesivir has been used to treat Ebola infections abroad, the report said.Although the drug has not gone through all the procedures of clinical trials on the coronavirus abroad, it has shown fairly good vitro activity in related domestic research, Sun Yanrong, an official of the ministry, told a media briefing.Besides Remdesivir, researchers have also selected from screening several existing drugs, including Chloroquine phosphate and Favipiravir, as well as some traditional Chinese medicines that contain active antiviral ingredients as drug candidates, for further animal experiments and clinical trials, Chinese health officials said.Amid all this development, the Wuhan Institute of Virology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences said on Tuesday that its researchers discovered that two medicines - Remdesivir and chloroquine - could effectively inhibit the recently emerged coronavirus.The institute said it has claimed for patent, triggering a debate on Chinese social media over whether the move violates intellectual property regulations (IPR), state-run Global Times reported on Wednesday.Chloroquine is a medicine that has been used to deal with malaria since the 1940s. It has been sold in the Chinese market and can be independently provided, the institute said. Meanwhile, Remdesivir, GS-5734, a medicine developed by the US medicine producer Gilead, is in phase two and phase three clinical research into its effectiveness against the Ebola virus in Congo.In order to protect national interests, the institute said that it applied to patent the discovery that Remdesivir can be used to deal with 2019-nCov and would apply for patents in other countries and regions through the Patent Cooperation Treaty. The institute called for foreign companies to withhold enforcing their lawful patent rights to help China fight against the coronavirus epidemic.The Wuhan institute's patent application has triggered heated discussions on Chinese social media. Some questioned whether the institute is allowed to apply to patent a medicine made by a US company in China, citing Chinese companies' and institutes' notorious history in allegedly stealing foreign intellectual property, the daily said.The alacrity with which Chinese firms and R&D institutes claim patents for foreign technology and discoveries had become a major friction between US and China over the years.The IPR theft and China's emphasis on technology transfer is part of a trade war between the world's two top economies. US President Donald Trump had launched the trade war with China in 2018 demanding Beijing to reduce massive trade deficit. His demands included an intrusive verification mechanism to supervise Beijing’s promise to protect intellectual property rights, technology transfer and more access to American goods to Chinese markets.The two countries signed phase one deal last month which reportedly contained provision for verification mechanism for IPR enforcement. "

The 28-year-old is thought to be one of six children — five brothers and a sister — raised by their taxi driver father Taj and his wife Parveen.Khan, whose body was reportedly secretly flown back to his family's ancestral village of Kajlani in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) this weekend, grew up in Cobridge area of Stoke-on-Trent where one of his siblings still lives.""I condemn their actions,"" Mohammed Pervez, leader of Stoke's Labour Party group in the area, told the newspaper. ""The graffiti will be offensive to the family of Usman Khan and to the wider community,"" he said.Last week, Khan's relatives issued a statement denouncing his attack and expressing condolences to the victims' families. Tagged with the letters ""COB"", the graffiti is believed to refer to a local gang calling themselves the Cobridge Boys.The rundown area is home to a large Pakistani community that moved to Stoke in the late 1950s and 1960s to work in the Potteries' ceramics factories.Khan was arrested with two others from Stoke as part of a nine-member Al Qaeda plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange and plans to set up a terrorist training factory in the garb of a madrassa on land owned by Khan’s family in PoK.He was jailed indefinitely for public protection in 2012, but this was replaced by a 16-year sentence on appeal. It meant he was freed in December 2018 after serving half his sentence and went on to stage the terror attack last month. "

One of the most dramatic claims in Prince Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfrey was that their son was denied a royal title, possibly because of the color of his skin. Queen Elizabeth II has nine great-grandchildren, including Archie. They are not princes and princesses, apart from the three children of Prince William, who is second in line to the throne and destined to be king one day.  One of the most dramatic claims in Prince Harry and Meghan’s interview with Oprah Winfrey was the allegation that their son was denied a royal title, possibly because of his skin color.Harry and Meghan’s son, seventh in line to the British throne, is Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. In contrast, the children of Harry’s older brother, Prince William, are Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.Meghan said that while she was pregnant “they” — presumably the palace — “were saying they didn’t want him to be a prince … which would be different from protocol.”She implied it might be a case of “the first member of color in this family not being titled in the same way that other grandchildren would be.”WAS ARCHIE SNUBBED?Queen Elizabeth II has nine great-grandchildren, including Archie. They are not princes and princesses, apart from the three children of Prince William, who is second in line to the throne and destined to be king one day.A decree issued by King George V in 1917 limits the titles of prince and princess to the children of the monarch, children of the monarch’s sons and “the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales” — that’s William’s son Prince George.Bob Morris from the Constitution Unit at University College London, said the rule was drawn up to trim the increasingly unwieldy number of princely titles.“Queen Victoria had nine children who were all princes and princesses, and then they had children and so forth, and George V took the view ... that something needed to be done to tidy up the situation,” he said.The queen has the power to amend the rules, and in 2012 she decreed that all the children of Prince William and his wife, Catherine, not just the eldest, would be princes and princesses.Under the George V convention, Archie is not a prince, but will become one as the grandchild of a monarch once current heir to the throne Prince Charles is king.In her interview, Meghan said she was told that “they want to change the convention for Archie.”It is unclear what she was referring to, but Morris said Prince Charles has let it be known “that he favors a smaller royal family” when he takes the throne.Archie was eligible for a “courtesy title” at birth, such as Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. At the time, it was reported that Harry and Meghan had chosen not to give him a title.But Meghan told Winfrey that “it was not our decision to make.”DOES THE TITLE AFFECT ARCHIE’S SECURITY?Meghan expressed concern that without a title, Archie “wasn’t going to receive security.”But a royal title such as prince or princess does not automatically bring security protection. Full-time working royals — including Meghan and Harry before they moved to North America last year — receive taxpayer-funded police bodyguards. Senior royals who have jobs outside the family, such as Prince Andrew’s daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, do not.WHAT DOES THE PALACE SAY?Buckingham Palace has not responded to specific allegations in the interview. In a statement, it said “the issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.”"
0c309890b4bf0b5aa9b43f8f1e25ae03,"Acknowledging his push to broker peace in the Middle East has stalled, President Donald Trump appeared to threaten to cut off US aid money to the Palestinian Authority, asking why the US should make “any of these massive future payments” when the Palestinians are “no longer willing to talk peace.”Trump, in a pair of tweets, said “we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.”Related Stories Palestine envoy warns of 'holy war' if US transfers its embassy to JerusalemErdogan wants world to recognise East Jerusalem as 'capital of Palestine' Islamic summit in Istanbul declares East Jerusalem as Palestine's capital“They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue ... peace treaty with Israel,” he wrote.Trump infuriated Palestinians and Muslims across the Middle East when he announced late last year that the U.S. would consider Jerusalem the capital of Israel and move its embassy there, upending decades of U.S. policy and igniting protests.While the Palestinians haven’t closed the door to a potential deal with Israel, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said the announcement had destroyed Trump’s credibility as a Mideast peace broker, calling the decision “a declaration of withdrawal from the role it has played in the peace process.”Senior Palestinian leader Hanan Ashrawi said in a statement Wednesday that Trump had “singlehandedly destroyed the very foundations of peace” with his Jerusalem declaration.Tuesday’s tweets are a tacit admission by Trump that his decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has thrown a wrench into his administration’s plans to restart the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, which he had dubbed “the ultimate deal.”Trump tasked son-in-law Jared Kushner with restarting the effort, and brought his former attorney, Jason Greenblatt, into the White House to lead the negotiations. Trump’s Mideast peace team had held meetings with Israeli, Palestinian and Arab leaders for nearly a year ahead of an expected peace proposal.But by recognizing Israel’s claim to Jerusalem, Trump was seen by the Palestinians as siding with Israel on the most sensitive issue in the conflict. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem — which Israel captured in 1967 — for their capital.Trump said his decision merely recognized the reality that Jerusalem already serves as Israel’s capital and wasn’t meant to prejudge the final borders of the city.In his tweets, Trump argued his decision had taken “Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more.”When Trump declared Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital, he insisted, counterintuitively, that the move would improve, not hurt, prospects for clinching a peace deal.In the days after the decision, Trump administration officials said the strategy was based on the notion that Israel had lost faith in the U.S. as a committed partner during the Obama administration. With trust in Washington restored, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government would be more inclined going forward to make tough concessions that would ultimately be needed for a peace deal, the U.S. officials argued at the time, and Israeli officials quietly indicated that they could potentially do so.No one spelled out, however, what the Palestinians would receive in return.Trump on Tuesday also issued a threat to cut off foreign aid dollars to an unspecified list of countries that don’t reciprocate.“It’s not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others,” Trump wrote, appearing to reference a Jan. 1 tweet lambasting Pakistan for failing to do enough to combat terror groups while taking U.S. aid. “No more!” Trump had tweeted Monday.Trump’s language marks a striking departure from decades of bipartisan American practice and reflects Trump’s transactional view of global affairs. U.S. leaders of both parties have long utilized foreign assistance dollars — a minor percentage of the overall budget — to promote American interests abroad, alleviate humanitarian crises and support oppressed peoples.Trump’s envoy to the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, foreshadowed Trump’s warning earlier Tuesday at the U.N. Security Council. Haley said the president doesn’t want to give more funds “until the Palestinians are willing to come back to the negotiation table.”“We still very much want to have a peace process. Nothing changes with that. The Palestinians now have to show they want to come to the table,” Haley said. “As of now, they’re not coming to the table, but they ask for aid. We’re not giving the aid. We’re going to make sure that they come to the table.”Since a Dec. 21 U.N. vote condemning Trump’s Jerusalem decision, U.S. officials have been weighing various options for retaliating against the Palestinians for pushing the resolution, which passed by a 128-9 margin.Those options, which were to be discussed by Trump’s top national security aides at a meeting next week, included several involving cutting off some or all aid to the Palestinian Authority. Another option would cut funding to the U.N. agency that provides services to the Palestinians in places like Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon.The talks are in their very early stages, with no determination yet of a fixed amount or percentage of assistance to be cut, according to officials familiar with the discussions.However, the officials noted that only a relatively small amount of the more than $220 million that the U.S. was planning to send to the Palestinians in the current budget year actually goes to the Palestinian Authority. Most of that assistance flows to non-governmental groups that are involved in building civic organizations that promote good governance, anti-corruption efforts, and health and education projects.The officials said one possibility would be to redirect aid from the Palestinian Authority to those groups. Similar proposals were envisioned for the U.N. relief agency for Palestinians, the officials said, noting that Palestinian children in Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon would be disproportionally affected by an immediate and complete cut-off.Chris Gunness, a spokesperson for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East, said it had not been informed of any changes to U.S. funding at this time.One basket of money that is unlikely to be affected is security assistance that helps the Palestinian Authority coordinate police cooperation with Israel, the officials said. They spoke on conditions of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about internal deliberations."

62af7d973c388f56ba90d9584f37c81d,"Turkey says it won’t bow to US threat over its Syria plansTrump said earlier this week the United States would step aside for an expected Turkish attack on Syrian Kurdish fighters, who have fought alongside Americans for years, but he then threatened to destroy the Turks’ economy if they went too far.The U.S. president later cast his decision to abandon the Kurdish fighters in Syria as fulfilling a campaign promise to withdraw from “endless war” in the Middle East, even as Republican critics and others said he was sacrificing a U.S. ally and undermining American credibility.Trump’s statements have reverberated on all sides of the divide in Syria and the Mideast.In Ankara, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Turkey was intent on combatting Syrian Kurdish fighters across its border in Syria and on creating a zone that would allow Turkey to resettle Syrian refugees there.“Where Turkey’s security is concerned, we determine our own path but we set our own limits,” Oktay said.Meanwhile, in the Syrian capital of Damascus, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad called on the country’s Kurds to rejoin the government side after apparently being abandoned by their U.S. allies.Mekdad’s comments were the first Syrian reaction since Trump’s announcement on Sunday and as northeastern Syria braces for an imminent Turkish attack on Syrian Kurdish militias. Trump’s statement has infuriated the Kurds, who stand to lose the autonomy they gained from Damascus during Syria’s civil war, now in its ninth year.“The homeland welcomes all its sons and Damascus will solve all Syrian problems in a positive way, away from violence,” Mekdad claimed in an interview with the pro-government daily Al-Watan.President Bashar Assad’s government abandoned the predominantly Kurdish area in northern Syria at the height of Syria’s civil war to focus on more key areas where the military was being challenged by the rebels. The U.S. began working with the Syrian Kurdish fighters after the emergence of the Islamic State group.The Syrian government “will defend all Syrian territory and will not accept any occupation of any land or iota of the Syrian soil,” Mekdad said about the expected Turkish incursion.The Syrian Kurdish force has pledged to fight back, raising the potential for an eruption of new warfare in Syria.“We will not hesitate for a moment in defending our people” against Turkish troops, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said in a statement, adding that it has lost 11,000 fighters in the war against the Islamic State group in Syria.On Tuesday, a spokesman for the U.S.-backed predominantly Kurdish force that fought IS invited Trump to come see the progress the force and the U.S. made in northeastern Syria.“We have more work to do to keep ISIS from coming back & make our accomplishments permanent. If America leaves, all will be erased,” he tweeted, referring to the Islamic State group by an alternative acronym.Turkey, which considers Kurdish fighters in Syria terrorists and links them to a decades-old insurgency in Turkey, has already launched two major incursions into northern Syria over the past years. The first was in 2016, when Turkey and Syrian opposition fighters it backs attacked areas held by the Islamic State group west of the Euphrates River. Last year Turkey launched an attack on the Syrian Kurdish enclave of Afrin, leading to the displacement of some 300,000 people.Also Tuesday, Iran urged Turkey not to go ahead with its planned an attack on Syrian Kurds, the Iranian state TV reported. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to express Tehran’s opposition to the anticipated Turkish operation.Zarif urged Turkey to respect Syria’s integrity and sovereignty, the report said.Iran, Turkey and Russia have been working together as part of the so-called Astana group on the Syrian civil war, talks that have run parallel to U.N. efforts to find a solution to the conflict.Trump’s announcement threw the military situation in Syria into fresh chaos and injected deeper uncertainty into the region.U.S. involvement in Syria has been fraught with peril since it started in 2014 with the insertion of small numbers of special operations forces to recruit, train, arm and advise local fighters to combat the Islamic State. Trump entered the White House in 2017 intent on getting out of Syria, and even before the counter-IS military campaign reclaimed the last militant strongholds early this year, he declared victory and said troops would leave.In recent weeks, the U.S. and Turkey had reached an apparent accommodation of Turkish concerns about the presence of Kurdish fighters, seen in Turkey as a threat. American and Turkish soldiers had been conducting joint patrols in a zone along the border. As part of that work, barriers designed to protect the Syrian Kurds were dismantled amid assurances that Turkey would not invade."

98783a6dfdd38ace232919a8a9ef0159,"US to keep about 650 troops in Afghanistan after withdrawal.  Roughly 650 U.S. troops are expected to remain in Afghanistan to provide security for diplomats after the main American military force completes its withdrawal, which is set to be largely done in the next two weeks, U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Thursday.In addition, several hundred additional American forces will remain at the Kabul airport, potentially until September, to assist Turkish troops providing security, as a temporary move until a more formal Turkey-led security operation is in place, the officials said. Overall, officials said the U.S. expects to have American and coalition military command, its leadership and most troops out by July Fourth, or shortly after that, meeting an aspirational deadline that commanders developed months ago.The officials were not authorized to discuss details of the withdrawal and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.The departure of the bulk of the more than 4,000 troops that have been in the country in recent months is unfolding well before President Joe Biden’s Sept. 11 deadline for withdrawal. And it comes amid accelerating Taliban battlefield gains, fueling fears that the Afghan government and its military could collapse in a matter of months.Officials have repeatedly stressed that security at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul is a critical requirement to keeping any U.S. diplomatic staff in Afghanistan. Still, the decision to keep additional troops there for several more months makes it more complicated for the Biden administration to declare a true end to America’s longest war until later this fall. And it keeps the embattled country near the forefront of U.S. national security challenges, even as the White House tries to put the 20-year-old war behind it and focus more on threats from China and Russia.In a statement Thursday night, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that as Biden has ordered, the U.S. will complete the withdrawal by early September. “Nothing has changed about that goal.” Kirby said. “The situation is dynamic, and we review our progress daily. Speculation by unnamed sources about potential changes to that timeline should not be construed as predictive.”On Friday, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, chair of the High Council for National Reconciliation, are meeting with Biden at the White House. The two Afghan leaders also are to meet at the Pentagon with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and possibly other administration officials, the Pentagon announced.Getting most troops out by early July had been in doubt because of complications including an outbreak of COVID-19 at the U.S. Embassy and the push to get Afghan interpreters and others who helped the U.S. out of the country. Officials said U.S. commanders and NATO allies in Afghanistan have been able to overcome logistical hurdles that might have prolonged the withdrawal process. But they also warned that plans in place for the final stages of the U.S. military withdrawal could change if airport security agreements fall through or there are other major, unforeseen developments.As recently as last week, there was discussion of possibly extending the U.S. troop presence at Bagram Airfield, north of Kabul, but officials said the U.S. presence at the base is expected to end in the next several days.The roughly 650 U.S. troops that are planned to be a more permanent force presence in Afghanistan will provide security for the U.S. Embassy and some ongoing support at the airport. Officials said the U.S. has agreed to leave a C-RAM — or Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar system — at the airport, as well as troops to operate it, as part of an agreement with Turkey. The U.S. also plans to leave aircrew for helicopter support at the airport.According to the officials, Turkey has largely agreed to provide security at the airport as long as it receives support from American forces. U.S. and Turkish military officials are meeting in Ankara this week to finalize arrangements.On Wednesday, Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there is not yet a written agreement with Turks on airport security. He said he did not want to speak about specifics before there is a final agreement, but added, “I feel very comfortable that security at the Kabul airport will be maintained and the Turks will be a part of that.”The U.S. troop departure, which began with Biden’s announcement in April that he was ending U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, is ramping up just as the administration moves ahead with plans to evacuate tens of thousands of interpreters and others who worked with American forces during the war and now fear for their safety.A senior administration official said Thursday that planning has accelerated in recent days to relocate the Afghans and their families to other countries or U.S. territories while their visa applications are processed. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss unannounced plans. The administration intends to carry out the evacuation later this summer, likely in August, according to a second official familiar with the deliberations but not authorized to discuss them publicly.The Pentagon has said the military is prepared to assist the State Department as needed but indicated that charter flights might be adequate to move the Afghan visa applicants, thus not necessarily requiring a military airlift.Officials said that NATO allies, such as Germany, are also very close to being completely out of the country.Senior Pentagon leaders, including Austin, have been cautious in recent weeks when asked about the troop withdrawal, and they have declined to provide any public details on when the last troops would leave, citing security concerns.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

No sooner had President Donald Trump finished his State of the Union address than House Speaker Pelosi ripped the paper it was printed on in two. Right there, on camera, behind Trump’s back. As he stepped down, she ripped again. Then a third time. And a fourth. If Trump knew about the American carnage going on behind him, he didn’t react as he left. But Pelosi was on her turf, with a deep understanding of her audience — and she wasn’t finished. In case any confusion remained, Pelosi held up what remained of the address to her family in the gallery, in full view of reporters.Image Source : APHouse Speaker Pelosi rips up Trump speech, right there on the podiumHouse Speaker Pelosi rips up Trump speech, right there on the podium“It was a manifesto of mistruths,” Pelosi told reporters as she left the Capitol. The ripping was not planned, according to a person close to the speaker who was unauthorized to speak publicly.Republicans dismissed her display, on the eve of Trump’s acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial, as a tantrum.“She might as well rip up any plans for attracting independent voters,” said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh. “Pelosi and the Democrats sat on their hands through all of the good news for Americans in that speech.”House Speaker Pelosi rips up Trump speech, right there on the podiumHouse Speaker Pelosi rips up Trump speech, right there on the podium“This speech was about American heroes and American workers. She decided THAT was worth literally tearing apart,” tweeted Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican vote-counter.Tearing the speech gave Pelosi the last visual word over Trump, who had spoken to the House from a position of strength. He arrived in the chamber with the full force of the Republican Party behind him. She is leading a party in the throes of a divisive presidential nomination fight that had botched the kickoff Iowa caucuses only the night before. The House had impeached Trump on her watch. But the Senate was poised to acquit him.From the start, the event was awkward because the history between those two was so icy. They had not spoken since October, when Pelosi pointed at Trump over a White House conference table, suggested that Russia controls him and walked out.Image Source : AP House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., walks with the envelope that holds the copy of President Donald Trump's State of the Union address she tore up after he delivered it to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2020.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., walks with the envelope that holds the copy of President Donald Trump's State of the Union address she tore up after he delivered it to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2020.Now, Trump was returning to the very chamber where he was impeached, standing before the same Democrats who have called him unfit for office and sought to oust him. He stepped to the podium and handed navy blue folders containing his speech to Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence. Photos from that moment show that Trump mistakenly handed Pence’s copy to Pelosi. The outside reads in gold letters: “The President of the Senate of the United States.” That’s Pence’s title.At that moment, Pelosi extended a hand. Trump did not acknowledge it, instead turning around to begin his speech.Pelosi, famous for casting shade, especially on Trump, gave a look.For 78 minutes, Trump went on to extol a “Great American Comeback” on his watch, just three years after he took office decrying a land of “American carnage” under his predecessor. Pelosi read through her copy as he spoke.Trump bestowed the Medal of Honor on Rush Limbaugh to raucous applause and a glum reception from House Democrats.“My fellow Americans, the best is yet to come,” he finished. Pelosi had already gathered the papers for her big finish.The moment was a less joyful echo of last year’s State of the Union, when Pelosi stole the show with a smirk-and-clap, eye to eye with Trump. Then, Democrats were triumphant after election gains that flipped the House from Republican control and put Pelosi back in the speaker’s chair.Image Source : AP House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., tears her copy of President Donald Trump's s State of the Union address after he delivered it to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2020.

a722804a5220fb29251f1d6815fff411,"Imran Khan on Beijing Airport with the Chinese officialIn what is being perceived as a snub to Pakistan, China sent a junior government official to receive Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Beijing Airport on Thursday. Imran Khan is in China to attend Belt and Road Forum. The conference kicks-off on Friday. Visiting head of states such as Presidents or Prime Ministers are normally received by his counterpart of the host country on the airport. In a situation where the host is not able to receive the visitor personally, a high ranking minister or a government official is sent to receive the guest on his arrival in the country.However, Imran Khan was visited by Li Lifeng, Deputy Secretary General of Beijing Municipal Committee. Although both nation will play down the issue and neither is likely to utter the word ""snub"" on record, absence of a high-ranking official is sure to raise eyebrows considering Pakistan and China claim to be each others' ""all-weather friends"".The Belt and Road Forum is about China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Under the BRI, China is building an ambitious global infrastructural network on land and at sea.

India and Pakistan are part of the regional security grouping and leaders of both the countries are set to attend the meeting in Bishkek.In a letter written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, Pakistan premier Imran Khan had requested resumption of talks between the two countries to resolve all differences. But no meeting has been planned between them on the sidelines of the summit.Haqqani's remarks also came on a day the government in Islamabad presented its national budget amid an austerity drive to wriggle the country out of the financial mess it is Earlier this month on Eid festival, Khan said there will be no increase in the defence budget because of ""our critical financial situation"". The defence budget presented Tuesday reflected that sentiment with no increase proposed in expenditure compared to last fiscal.Weeks ago, Khan's government negotiated a USD 6 billion bailout package with the International Monetary Fund to overcome the financial woes.Haqqani said another high-level meeting between India and Pakistan would be meaningless unless it is accompanied by dismantling of terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and giving up the notion of the two countries being ""permanent enemies"".""Between 1950 and December 2015, when Modi dropped in on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Lahore, leaders of the two countries have met 45 times,"" he said, but talks have never led to durable peace. ""The door to negotiations must never be considered permanently shut but nor should dialogue be an end in itself,"" he reiterated.Haqqani, now the director for South and Central Asia at the Hudson Institute, is considered an uncompromising critic of the Pakistani establishment and the Jihadi ideology. He has often voiced his disagreements with the establishment during public discussions.In an article published recently, he wrote that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is right to have determined that “talks for talks’ sake are meaningless as long as Pakistan refuses to change its view of its larger neighbour as a permanent enemy.”In Haqqani's view hostility towards India emanates from Pakistan's national ideology based on religious identity and antipathy cultivated by the military that dominates the country.Like many other countries, India and Pakistan have unresolved disputes, he said, but other countries do not have national ideologies revolving around opposition to others. ""Pakistan tends to engage in talks with India for global respectability, but its dominant military is unable to shed its ideological aversion to normal ties with India,"" he stressed. The former diplomat cited the Pakistani military and said it was ""not raised proportionately to an external threat"".""It needs a threat proportionate to its size to justify its claims on the meagre resources of a low-income country,"" he said, adding Pakistan inherited one-third of British India's army, which had originally been raised for the Second World War.(Except for the headline, IndiaTVnews.com has not edited anything in the story)"

But mail ballots generally require more time to process than ballots that are cast in person.US Election 2020: Full CoverageDIFFERENT STATES, DIFFERENT APPROACHESSome states with extensive experience in using mail-in ballots have adjusted for those extra steps.In Florida, clerks can start counting ballots 22 days before an election. In North Carolina, beginning five weeks before the election, county boards insert approved ballots into a voting machine, allowing for a prompt tabulation on Election Day.But other states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all with Republican-led legislatures and all of them swing states, made a conscious decision to wait. There will be no counting of mail-in ballots prior to Election Day, As a result, it could take days to tally enough ballots to project a winner.US Election 2020: LIVE UPDATESThe wrangling in the states over the use of mail-in ballots has come as President Donald Trump claims that mail voting is ripe for fraud.ELECTION DAY ISN’T ALWAYS THE DEADLINEAnd here’s another wrinkle that could delay the naming of a winner: In some key states, mail-in ballots can come in several days after Election Day and still be counted, as long as they are postmarked by then. Democrats have argued that the flood of absentee ballots and slow mail delivery in some areas makes such a precaution necessary.US Election 2020: All you need to know about the presidential raceFor example, mail-in ballots from Nevada voters are not due until Nov. 10 if postmarked by Election Day.

d08ed91031abf5eaa29dafa813b1bdfc,"What is the Moderna COVID vaccine? Does it work, and is it safe?Boston-based pharmaceutical company Moderna announced a new supply agreement with Australia for 25 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine. The deal includes ten million doses against the original strain of the coronavirus to be delivered this year. This vaccine has been widely used in countries such as Canada, United States and the United Kingdom under emergency use authorisations granted by these countries and the World Health Organisation.Moderna’s deal with Australia also includes 15 million doses of its updated variant booster vaccine candidate, estimated to be delivered in 2022.The agreement is subject to approval by Australia’s drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), for both the original vaccine and the booster. Moderna expects to submit an application to the TGA “shortly”.Moderna’s vaccine against the original strain is given as two doses.Both this vaccine, and the updated booster, are mRNA vaccines (like the Pfizer vaccine). The vaccine contains genetic instructions for our cells to make the coronavirus’ “spike protein”. The mRNA is wrapped in an oily shell that protects it from being immediately degraded by the body, and ensures it’s delivered into cells after injection.Once in the cell, the mRNA is converted into spike protein that can be recognised by the immune system. Our immune system then builds an immune response against the spike protein, and learns how to fight off the coronavirus if we encounter it in future.Moderna’s vaccine remains stable at -20°C, the temperature of a household freezer, for up to six months. It can remain refrigerated at 4°C for up to 30 days.As most pharmaceutical logistic companies are capable of storing and transporting products at -20°C, it’s relatively easy to store and distribute this vaccine. By contrast, Pfizer’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine needs to be stored long-term below -60°C, though unopened vials can be stored at freezer temperatures for up to two weeks.Phase 3 clinical trials of the vaccine, with over 30,000 participants, showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing COVID-19 as well as complete protection against severe forms of the disease.Researchers did not identify safety concerns, with the most common side effects being transient pain at the injection site, and headache or tiredness that typically lasted for up to three days.These clinical trials, however, largely occurred prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. These include B.1.1.7, which emerged from the United Kingdom, and B.1.351, first detected in South Africa.Can it protect against variants? Subsequent studies have investigated the potential for these variants to escape the protection offered by Moderna’s vaccine. Preliminary studies have identified slight, although not significant, reductions in the protection it offers against the B.1.351 variant, originating in South Africa.In response to this data, Moderna updated its mRNA vaccine formulation to account for the changes in the spike protein present in the B.1.351 variant. In March this year, it started phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to investigate the safety and ability of its variant vaccine to provoke an immune response.Preliminary, preclinical studies suggest vaccination with the variant vaccine was effective at increasing neutralising antibodies against the B.1.351 variant.Preclinical studies also suggest a vaccine containing an equal mix of its original vaccine, and the B.1.351 vaccine, was most effective at providing broad cross-variant protection, including against the P.1 variant that originated in Brazil.In people already fully vaccinated against the original strain, clinical studies demonstrated a booster dose of Moderna’s variant vaccine achieved a higher number of neutralising antibodies against the B.1.351 variant, than simply giving a booster dose of Moderna’s original strain vaccine.Moderna’s vaccines can be rapidly reformulated to target emerging variants. This is largely thanks to the splendour of the mRNA technology, simply requiring the genetic sequence of the virus.It’s possible Moderna will be able to update its vaccine to cover future variants of the coronavirus so we can quickly provide people with protection to emerging strains.Moderna revealed it’s in discussions with the federal government about manufacturing its vaccines onshore in Australia. This follows news that both Victoria and New South Wales have committed money towards developing mRNA vaccine manufacturing capability.This is a move that would not only further secure Australia’s supply of COVID-19 vaccines, but kick start the development of an industry within Australia that has the potential to impact multiple diseases.ALSO READ: ""Sputnik V is Russian-Indian vaccine"", says Russian Ambassador to India"

39538d8c42b6d760913f46d88a41bf7d,"Representational ImageAn Indian-origin man has been charged in the US with H-1B visa and mail fraud, officials said.Kishore Kumar Kavuru, 46, was arrested on Friday and was presented before US Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen, the US Department of Justice said in a press release.He was charged with 10 counts of visa fraud and 10 counts of mail fraud in connection with a scheme to maintain a pool of foreign workers for the clients of Kavuru's consulting companies. If convicted, Kavuru faces the sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000 for each count of visa fraud. The defendant also faces up to 20 years in jail and $250,000 for each count of mail fraud, federal prosecutors said. According to the indictment, Kavuru, a resident of Sunnyvale, California, held himself out as a staffing specialist for technology firms based in Santa Clara County and elsewhere seeking to fill temporary positions with foreign workers. Since at least as early as 2007, Kavuru was the owner and Chief Executive Officer of four consulting companies -- Scopus Consulting Group, Inc.; ITECH Analyst Corp; Infinity Methods Corp; and Orian Engineers Incorporated. The indictment described how Kavuru used the consulting companies to process and submit fraudulent applications for foreign workers to obtain permission to work in the US under the H-1B visa programme. He was accused of submitting fraudulent documents to both the Department of Labour and the Department of Homeland Security, containing details of bogus work projects awaiting the foreign workers.Because many of the applications were ultimately approved, Kavuru had a pool of unemployed H-1B beneficiaries that were immediately available for legitimate work projects, giving him a competitive advantage over other law-abiding staffing companies that followed the sometimes lengthy visa application process for petitioning foreign workers, according to federal prosecutors.As part of the scheme, Kavuru required some prospective workers to pay thousands of dollars in cash before he would prepare and submit the visa applications. Kavuru also required some workers to wait unpaid, sometimes for months, to be placed at an end-client's workplace. Through his consulting companies, Kavuru submitted and mailed approximately 43 petitions for H-1B software engineers, the statement said.""In fact, there were no software engineer positions available at the benefits company,"" federal prosecutors said.         "

We are at a low level right now,” he said.In comments Wednesday to The Washington Post, however, Fauci seemed to clarify his earlier remarks, saying that unlike the “full-blown explosive pandemic phase” during the brutal winter omicron surge, he was describing what appears to be a period of transition toward the coronavirus becoming an endemic disease.“The world is still in a pandemic. There’s no doubt about that. Don’t anybody get any misinterpretation of that.

2e49c2f4e5c039b8e91cf4df9a49ec75,"President Donald Trump’s lengthy Asia trip wound down as it began, with a visit meant to be centered on trade and North Korea shadowed by questions about Russia.Trump was in the Philippines, the final stop of his trip, on Monday, poised to hold formal talks with President Rodrigo Duterte, who has overseen a bloody drug war that has featured extrajudicial killings and fears of vigilante justice. But Trump remains dogged by things he has said, and has not said, about Russia.Days before he left for the five-nation Asia trip, Trump’s campaign chairman was indicted on charges he laundered millions of dollars through overseas shell companies and a campaign adviser pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. And while White House aides have been pleased with the president’s messaging through stops in Japan, South Korea and China, Trump has brought Russia to the forefront again as he makes his final stops.He tried to have it both ways Sunday on the issue of Russian interference in last year’s presidential race, saying he believes both the U.S. intelligence agencies when they say Russia meddled and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s sincerity in claiming that his country did not.“I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election,” Trump said of Putin at a news conference in Hanoi with Vietnam’s president.“As to whether I believe it, I’m with our agencies,” Trump said. “As currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.”U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to help the Republican Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. A special counsel’s examination of potential collusion between Moscow and Trump campaign aides so far has led to indictments against Trump’s former campaign chairman and another top aide for crimes unrelated to the campaign, and a guilty plea from a Trump foreign policy adviser.Multiple congressional committees are also investigating.On Saturday, Trump lashed out at former heads of the U.S. intelligence agencies, claiming there are plenty of reasons to be suspicious of their findings and dismissing them as “political hacks.”John Brennan, the former CIA director, responded Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Trump was dismissing the former officials — himself included — as “political hacks” in an attempt to “delegitimize” the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in the election.“I think Mr. Putin is very clever in terms of playing to Mr. Trump’s interest in being flattered. And also I think Mr. Trump is, for whatever reason, either intimidated by Mr. Putin, afraid of what he could do or what might come out as a result of these investigations,” Brennan said.James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, called the threat from Russia “manifest and obvious.”“To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding and, in fact, poses a peril to this country,” Clapper said on “State of the Union.”Questions about whether Trump believes the assessment about Russian election-meddling have trailed him since January, when he said for the first time, shortly before taking office, that he accepted that Russia was behind the election-year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race.Trump told reporters traveling with him to Hanoi on Saturday that Putin had again vehemently denied the allegations. The two spoke during an economic conference in Danang, Vietnam. Trump danced around questions about whether he believed Putin but stressed Putin’s denials.“Every time he sees me, he says: ‘I didn’t do that.’ And I believe — I really believe — that when he tells me that, he means it,” Trump said, arguing that it makes no sense for him to belabor the issue when Russia could help the U.S. on North Korea, Syria and other issues.In Hanoi on Sunday, Trump also pointed to sanctions the U.S. has imposed on Russia as punishment for election meddling. “They were sanctioned at a very high level, and that took place very recently,” he said. “It’s now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken.”Trump was originally slated to depart Manila for Washington on Monday. He added a day to the schedule amid criticism that he would have missed the final summit.Now Trump is slated to attend the Association for Southeast Asian Nations conference on Monday to urge allies to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program. And he is expected, in meetings with other leaders, to push his agenda for bilateral, rather than multinational, trade agreements."
4be685d53a22990315fbce26b82eb15a,"A deadly shooting at Israel’s Embassy in Jordan further complicated Israeli government efforts on Monday to find a way out of an escalating crisis over Jerusalem’s most contested holy site, including mass Muslim prayer protests and Israeli-Palestinian violence.The shooting, in which an Israeli security guard killed two Jordanians after being attacked by one of them with a screwdriver, came as a U.S. envoy headed to the region to try to defuse the crisis over the shrine.The trip by Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt was the first sign of a high-level, on-the-ground involvement by the Trump administration to end the standoff between Israel and the Muslim world.The escalation began earlier this month when Arab gunmen fired from the holy site, killing two Israeli policemen. In response, Israel installed metal detectors at the site, a move that incensed the Muslim world.Jordan is the Muslim custodian of the Jerusalem site, which is also revered by Jews and has played a key role in efforts to end the standoff.The shooting at Israel’s embassy in the Jordanian capital of Amman is bound to raise friction between the two countries and further inflame Jordanian public opinion against Israel.The Amman shooting took place on Sunday evening in a residential building used by the embassy staff, Israel’s Foreign Ministry said.The ministry said the incident began when two Jordanian workmen arrived at the residential building to replace furniture. It said one of the workers, identified by Israeli media as a 17-year-old of Palestinian origin, attacked an Israeli security guard with a screwdriver.The guard opened fire, killing the teen, the media reports said. A second Jordanian, the owner of the building, was hit by gunfire and later died of his wounds. Jordanian police said the building owner was a physician. The Israeli guard was lightly hurt, the media reports said. Israeli media said Jordan has demanded to conduct an investigation and has prevented Israeli Embassy staff from leaving the premises. Jordanian government officials were not immediately available for comment.The Israeli Foreign Ministry did not refer to a possible standoff in its statement, but said the guard has diplomatic immunity under international conventions.An Israeli government official would not say whether the security guard was being prevented by Jordanian authorities from leaving the kingdom. He said talks were under way whether to evacuate the embassy staff, given the tensions in Jordan.He said either all or none of the staff would be evacuated, and that the security guard would not be left behind. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the diplomatic efforts underway to defuse the situation.Israel’s security Cabinet met from late Sunday until the early hours of Monday to discuss the crisis at the shrine, and was briefed during the meeting about the incident at the Amman embassy, the Foreign Ministry said.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone to Israel’s ambassador in Jordan, Eynat Schleyn, the ministry said.Israel and Jordan signed a peace deal in 1994, but the agreement remains deeply unpopular in the kingdom where many residents are of Palestinian origin. Jordan and Israel have close security ties, but frequently clash over Israeli policies at the Jerusalem shrine.Jordan’s ruling Hashemite dynasty, said to trace its ancestry to the Prophet Muhammad, draws much of its legitimacy from its role as protector of the shrine.Meanwhile, the security Cabinet reached no decision after a six-hour meeting on how to defuse the crisis over the Jerusalem shrine, Israeli media said. The ministers were reportedly reviewing the initial decision on installing the metal detectors and weighing possible alternatives.Israel has said the metal detectors were a needed security measure to prevent future attacks. However, the government is facing growing domestic criticism, with some commentators saying it did not fully weigh all the repercussions of introducing new measures at the most volatile spot of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Muslim religious leaders have alleged that Israel is trying to expand its control at the site under the guise of security — a claim Israel denies.The tensions have led to mass prayer protests and Israeli-Palestinian violence.The 37-acre walled compound is the third holiest site of Islam, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. It is also the holiest site of Judaism, revered as the place where biblical Temples once stood.A White House official said Greenblatt was on his way to the region, in the U.S. administration’s first foray into the crisis. Greenblatt will coordinate his efforts with Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well the State Department and the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman.The Israeli daily Haaretz said Greenblatt would arrive on Monday."

It was the first time in a week daily toll dipped below 700. However, Governor Andrew Cuomo said that people are still dying at a “horrific level of pain and grief and sorrow.”“This virus is very good at what it does. It is a killer,” news agency AP quoted Cuomo as saying during a state Capitol news briefing.Cuomo said almost 2,000 people were newly hospitalized with the virus Sunday, though once discharges and deaths are accounted for, the number of people hospitalized has flattened to just under 19,000.Meanwhile, New York City is in danger of running out of swabs for COVID-19 tests and is urging medical providers to continue testing only patients who are gravely ill, the city health department said in a memo to health care providers.“As the swab supply continues to decline, there is a real possibility hospitals will completely run out,” the April 11 health alert said. “At this time, providers are reminded to only test hospitalized patients in order to preserve resources that are needed to diagnose and appropriately manage patients with more severe illness.”The warning came amid repeated pleas from New York City and state officials for the federal government to provide widespread testing in order to move to a containment phase in the coronavirus outbreak.“If the president of the United States or anyone else wants a recovery — and we all want it, right? But if you’re serious about it, you can’t do it without widespread testing,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a City Hall briefing Monday.The city’s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, said the city “won’t be able to get this over the finish line, if you will, if we don’t have the supply that the mayor is calling for or the assistance of the federal government.”Through Sunday afternoon, 462,000 people in New York have been tested for the virus, according to state figures. Of those, nearly 189,000 had tested positive.Because of rationing, just 44% of tests conducted in the state have been done in New York City, even though the city represents 74% of the state’s fatalities from the virus.Lack of testing capability, partly due to rationing of personal protective equipment for the people who would have to administer them, has also stopped officials from doing widespread testing of hospital and nursing home staff who might be passing infections to each other and to patients.(With inputs from AP)ALSO READ | UK coronavirus death toll crosses 10,000 mark"

The latest news of arrest of additional 90 students, first reported on Tuesday by the 'Detroit Free Press', has resulted in outrage with #AbolishICE hashtag gaining ground on Twitter and other social media platforms on Wednesday. When the fictitious university closed in March, there were 600 students, mostly Indians, enrolled in it.The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has so far arrested more than 250 students, who were lured to enroll in the now-closed University of Farmington in the Detroit metropolitan area by the Department of Homeland Security.According to an ICE spokesperson, of the 250 students arrested so far ""nearly 80 per cent were granted voluntary departure and departed the United States."" Of the remaining 20 percent, about half of them have received a final order of removal.Federal prosecutors claim that the students knew that this was a fake university as there were no classes. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, described the move as ""cruel"".""This is cruel and appalling,"" she said in a tweet. ""These students simply dreamed of getting the high-quality higher education America can offer. ICE deceived and entrapped them, just to deport them,"" Warren said.The ICE had filed criminal charge sheet against eight recruiters. Seven of them have pleaded guilty. The eight recruiters have been indicted for conspiracy to commit visa fraud and harbouring aliens for profit by the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan.Students enrolled in the university, a significant number of whom were from India, came to the US legally on a valid visa issued by the US embassy in India.The US ""trapped the vulnerable people who just wanted to maintain (legal immigration) status,"" Rahul Reddy, a Texas attorney who represented or advised some of the students told Detroit Free Journal.

The IMF's decision comes at the request of Pakistan, which faces an urgent balance of payment crisis. This is in addition to the USD 6 billion bailout package that Islamabad signed with the IMF in July last year to stave off a balance of payment crisis. ""The outbreak of COVID-19 is having a significant impact on the Pakistani economy,"" said Geoffrey Okamoto, the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair. The domestic containment measures coupled with the global downturn are severely affecting growth and straining external financing which has created an urgent balance of payments need, he said. ""As the crisis abates, the authorities' renewed commitment to the reforms in the existing Extended Fund Facility -- in particular those related to fiscal consolidation strategy, energy sector, governance, and remaining AML/CFT deficiencies -- will be crucial to entrench resilience, boost Pakistan's growth potential, and deliver broad-based benefits for all Pakistanis,"" Okamoto said. Expeditious donor support is needed to close the remaining balance of payments gap and ease the adjustment burden, he added. Okamoto said that in response to the crisis, the government of Pakistan has taken swift action to halt the community spread of the virus and introduced an economic stimulus package aimed at accommodating the spending needed to tackle the health emergency and supporting economic activity. ""Crucially, the authorities are increasing public health spending and strengthening social safety net programs to provide immediate relief to the most vulnerable,"" he said. ""Similarly, the State Bank of Pakistan has adopted a timely set of measures, including a lowering of the policy rate and new refinancing facilities, to support liquidity and credit conditions and safeguard financial stability. In this context, the authorities’ policies should be targeted and temporary,"" Okamoto said. (With IANS inputs)Also Read | Pakistan coronavirus cases rise to 6,919; 58% cases locally transmittedAlso Read | Hindu American Foundation raises funds for Hindus denied aid in Pakistan​"

This is an overwhelming call for marriage equality,"" he said after the result was announced.""They voted yes for fairness, yes for commitment, yes for love. And now it is up to us here in the parliament of Australia to get on with it.""Supporters began celebrating the result in public spaces across Australia on Wednesday, waving rainbow flags and singing and dancing.The conservative government had promised to allow the Parliament to consider a bill to create marriage equality in Australia in its final two-week session that is due to end on December. 7.While gay marriage could be a reality in Australia by Christmas, some government lawmakers have vowed to vote down gay marriage regardless of the survey's outcome.Opponents have also questions the legitimacy of any same-sex marriage law since several lawmakers could potentially be disqualified from Parliament due to a constitutional ban on dual citizens standing for election.Ireland is the only other country in the world to put the divisive issue to a popular vote.In Ireland, 61 percent of registered voters turned out for a referendum in 2015 and 62 percent of those voted to change the constitution to allow marriage equality.In Australia, almost 80 percent of voters supported gay-marriage, despite opponents describing it as a boutique issue that did not interest most of the public.Gay rights advocates had opposed the non-binding 100 million Australian dollar ($76 million) survey as an unnecessary obstacle to achieving equality.The Senate had refused to fund a compulsory vote, however, so the government opted for a voluntary postal ballot. Critics said it was unlikely to accurately reflect public opinion.The United Nations Human Rights Committee last week criticized Australia for putting gays and lesbians ""through an unnecessary and divisive public opinion poll."" The committee called on Australia to legislate for marriage equality regardless of the survey's outcome.In 2015, then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a high-profile same-sex marriage opponent, committed his conservative government to holding a compulsory nationwide vote to decide whether the unions should be legal.Abbott welcomed the survey saying that the parliament should ""respect the result"".""I always said this was an issue where the Australian people wanted their say and today's result demonstrates that seeking their views was the right thing to do,"" he wrote on Facebook.He was once head-butted by a gay rights advocate during the campaign in September.Abbott was replaced by current Turnbull, who supports marriage equality and opposed the public vote but eventually agreed to it in a deal with party powerbrokers. He is facing debate within his government over what the parliamentary bill should include.Australian lawmakers are already moving to wind back anti-discrimination laws to reduce barriers for people who would boycott gay weddings.Debate is intensifying on whether Australians who would refuse to provide gay weddings with a celebrant, venue, flowers or a cake should have added protection against anti-discrimination laws.Some conservative MPs are pushing for the bill to include exemptions that would allow businesses opposed to same-sex marriage to refuse goods and services for weddings.Several government lawmakers on Monday released a draft gay marriage bill that critics argue would diminish current protections for gays against discrimination on the grounds of sexuality.Turnbull on Tuesday ruled out downgrading anti-discrimination laws. (With agencies)  "

It's just disgusting to watch Pakistani officials celebrate the victory of this group that will bring untold brutality to the Afghan people,” Chabot said.“Pakistan's own persecution of religious minorities, however, gets a lot less attention here in America than it deserves. We would do well to educate our fellow citizens about these abuses.  Persecution is particularly manifests in the heinous practice of the kidnapping, force conversion to Islam and forced marriage of underage Hindu girls to older Muslim men,” he said. Such allegations are not mere hearsay, he noted.Major news organisations and human rights groups have documented the practice with so many heartbreaking stories of girls in their early teens taken from their families, and traffic into forced marriages. These abuses are often just ignored, said the Congressman.In his address, Chabot said that with roughly 6 million Hindus in America, Hindus are unquestionably an integral part of society throughout the United States. “Through strong work ethic and high educational attainment, Hindus exemplify the American dream. These virtues also allow Hindus to take on key roles in communities across the country, and also give back to those communities in so many ways,” he said.That is why the reports of a rise in discrimination against Hindu Americans around the country are so concerning, he rued, adding that there is no place in America for such discrimination. “We must all seek ways to bring it to an end,” Chabot added."

The decision has been taken to narrow the gap with that of companies impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The legislation to implement the decision will be submitted to the current extraordinary parliamentary session that runs until early December, reports Xinhua news agency.The changes are in line with the National Personnel Authority's recommendation, as bonuses in the private sector were found to be lower than that of public servants amid the economic slowdown induced by the pandemic.With the new legislation introduced on Friday, the annual summer and winter bonuses for national public servants for fiscal 2020 will be equivalent to the salary of 4.45 months, down 0.05-month worth of wages compared to last fiscal year.The annual income, meanwhile, will stand at an average of 6.73 million yen, down 21,000 yen.According to local media reports, since public servants are not permitted to go on strikes or carry out collective bargaining, the authority on their behalf annually proposes the appropriate salary levels to the Cabinet and parliament to make sure that the levels of their wages and bonuses are on par with employees in private sectors.(With inputs from IANS)Also Read | SBI inks agreement with Japan Bank for USD 1 billion loan"

It includes sanctions against countries that engage in significant transactions with Russia's defence and intelligence sectors. India is not going to allow its defence engagement with Russia to be dictated by any other country, the sources said, adding New Delhi has been lobbying with the Trump administration on the issue. India could face US sanctions for purchasing high value military defence items, in particular state-of-the-art S-400 Triumf missile defence system, from Russia under the act. In his opening remarks, Modi also thanked Russia for playing a major role in helping India get a permanent membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. India and Pakistan were admitted last year into the organisation.   ""We are working together on International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and BRICS,"" Modi said. He also congratulated Putin for becoming the President for the fourth time with overwhelming majority. ""Starting from the year 2000 when you took office, our relation has been historic...,"" Modi said. Welcoming Prime Minister Modi to Sochi, Putin said his visit would give a fresh impetus to bilateral ties. Image Source : PHOTO/TWITTER/@MEAINDIAPM Narendra Modi and Russian President Putin had plenty to discuss as they sail together from Bocharev Creek to Olympic Park in Sochi.

As of now, we understand that no Indian citizen has been affected by the outbreak & that food & water supplies are available to them,” Kumar said in a series of tweets to provide the latest update on the coronavirus outbreak.The official spokesperson said that the Ministry of External Affairs was in close touch with the Indian students who had been left behind in Wuhan and other parts of the Hubei province, which has borne the maximum brunt of the outbreak.He said that India’s embassy in China had opened three hotline numbers to facilitate the return of Indian citizens trapped in the Hubei province and Wuhan. Wuhan had been put under lockdown with transport restriction in place, after local authorities realised the magnitude of the outbreak on Jan 23.The reassuring message from the government official came just hours after Union External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Twitter that the Indian government was closely monitoring the well-being of Indian citizens in China.According to China’s government, the new coronavirus has so far resulted in 56 deaths, with 1,976 cases having been reported so far. Many independent journalists and claims doing the rounds of social media, however, dispute the Chinese government’s figures and say that as many as 1 lakh cases have been diagnosed so far.Meanwhile, at least 179 persons who had recently returned from China were placed under home observation in Kerala.

The semi-official Iraq High Commission for Human Rights, which accounts for violence in additional cities in southern Iraq, put the death toll at 63.Thousands of protesters tried to reach Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone, home to embassies and government offices. Security forces fired tear gas as protesters tried to remove blast walls from the main bridge leading to the government district. By nightfall, the security forces had chased the protesters back to Tahrir Square, a central roundabout.Image Source : APAnti-government protests rage in Iraq, 7 killedAnti-government protests rage in Iraq, 7 killed“I want change. I want to remove those corrupt people who sleep in the Green Zone and who fired tear gas and rubber bullets at us,” said protester Fares Mukhaled, 19, who sat barefoot on the ground at the square, where some had erected tents.Four people were killed when they were struck by tear gas canisters in Baghdad, security and medical officials said.A second medical official said three protesters were shot dead by security guards when they attacked the office of a provincial official in the southern town of Nasiriyah. The town in the mainly Shiite south has seen especially violent protests in recent weeks and was placed under a 24-hour curfew on Friday along with the southern city of Basra.At least 149 were killed in a wave of demonstrations earlier this month. The spontaneous, leaderless protests are directed at the political establishment that came to power after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, which many blame for spiraling corruption and poor public services.The protests against the Shiite-dominated government have been largely concentrated in Shiite areas. Some have also criticized Iran’s influence over the country. “Iraq is free. Iran out, out!” some protesters chanted in Tahrir Square.In the Shiite holy city of Karbala, a security official said demonstrators in a rally that took place outside the Iranian consulate also chanted for Iran to get out.Image Source : APAnti-government protests rage in Iraq, 7 killedAnti-government protests rage in Iraq, 7 killedThe Interior Ministry and the military issued statements Saturday saying some protesters have exploited the rallies to attack government buildings and political party offices.The ministry said some of its members were killed as police battled violent protesters but did not give a number. The military warned that it would take necessary and legal measures to deal with those it called saboteurs.Iraqi officials said 12 of those killed Friday died in a fire they had set when they stormed the office of a government-backed militia in the southern town of Diwaniyah. A security official said protesters torched the offices of at least three militias in southern Maysan province.All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.In Baghdad, Iraqi police had fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live shots on Friday to break up protesters who gathered in the central Tahrir Square and later tried to cross the bridge leading to the Green Zone. The protesters returned in Saturday, clashing with security forces throughout the day.The rallies have mainly been by young, unemployed men who are demanding jobs and better services. Young women appeared among the crowd in Baghdad for the first time Saturday, some handing out water to the protesters.A widow who identified herself as Um Layth, or the mother of Layth, said she had asked her son and daughter to stay home because she feared for their safety. But the 60-year-old from outside of Baghdad said she came to protest, wanting a better future for her children.“I am not afraid if I die, but I want a better future for my children,” she said. “If these parties and this government stay, they will have no future.”Iran emerged as a major power broker in Iraq after the 2003 invasion and has close ties to many of its political parties. Iran also backs a number of state-sanctioned militias that were mobilized in 2014 to battle the Islamic State group. Those militias have stood by the government and suggested the demonstrations are part of a foreign “conspiracy.”But Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, a nationalist whose supporters have the largest number of seats in parliament, has endorsed the protests and called on the government to resign. He has also suspended his bloc’s participation in the government until it comes up with a reform program.In a statement Saturday he called on political leaders to “keep their hands off (the people),” saying there had been enough “repression, injustice and divisions.” He warned them to change course so the country does not “slide into the fires of sedition and civil war.“Resign before you’re forced to resign,” he said.After his speech, hundreds of his supporters marched toward Tahrir Square. “We are carrying our own shrouds,” said Hussein Abdul-Khaleq, a 30-year old al-Sadr supporter, indicating he is not afraid to die.Also Read: Millions in California facing fire danger, more blackoutsAlso Read: China postpones inter-Afghan peace talks: Taliban"

9e0d4dc5694b7bbb03065cc8540df9e0,"Carbon emissionCarbon dioxide emissions are costing the Indian economy up to USD 210 billion every year, according to a global study which found that the country is likely to suffer highest economic damage from climate change after the US.  Previous research has focused on how rich countries benefit from the fossil fuel economy, while damages accrue primarily to the developing world.   However, researchers from University of California San Diego in the US found that the top three counties with the most to lose from climate change are US, India and Saudi Arabia.  ""The economic damages model indicates that as temperature rises, economic growth in India will slow,"" Katharine Ricke, an assistant professor at UC San Diego, told PTI.  Researchers estimated country-level contributions to the social cost of carbon (SCC) using recent climate model projections, empirical climate-driven economic damage estimations and socioeconomic forecasts.  The country-level SCC for the India alone is estimated to be about USD 86 per tonne of CO2.  At current emission levels, the Indian economy loses USD 210 billion annually, said Ricke, corresponding author of the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.  For US, the cost is about USD 50 billion per tonne. This means that the nearly five billion metric tonnes of CO2 the US emits each year is costing the US economy about USD 250 billion.  The model accounts for everything that happens in the economy today that is sensitive to environmental conditions, said Ricke.  ""This includes agricultural yields, vector borne disease, reduced worker productivity due to heat, increased frequency of extreme precipitation resulting in infrastructure damages or any of the other many ways that human systems get impacted by climate conditions,"" Ricke added.  ""The combination and interaction of all these factors translate into an observed effect on the country's economy as a whole,"" she said.  For the first time, researchers have developed a data set quantifying what the social cost of carbon will be for the globe's nearly 200 countries. The world's largest CO2 emitter, China, also places in the top five countries with the highest losses.  ""We all know carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels affects people and ecosystems around the world, today and in the future,"" said Ricke.  ""However these impacts are not included in market prices, creating an environmental externality whereby consumers of fossil fuel energy do not pay for and are unaware of the true costs of their consumption,"" said Ricke.  For example, claims that carbon dioxide causes relatively little harm to the economy can more easily justify rollbacks on environmental regulation.  ""Because this is a macroeconomic model based on empirical observations, this means that everything that happens in the economy today that is sensitive to environmental conditions is reflected in the model,"" she said.  ""This can be agricultural yields, vector borne disease, reduced worker productivity due to heat, increased frequency of extreme precipitation resulting in infrastructure damages or any of the other many ways that human systems get impacted by climate conditions,"" Ricke added."

f095b7c8b4f5f282229fd987d23c3fcd,"US President Joe BidenUS President Joe Biden on Thursday said he would likely seek reelection in 2024, but the 78-year-old Democrat left open the possibility of stepping aside after one term. “My plan is to run for reelection. That’s my expectation,” Biden told reporters in a wide-ranging news conference, the first of his young presidency.He later pushed back against a reporter’s suggestion that his 2024 plans were definite.“I said, ‘That is my expectation,’” Biden said. “I’m a great respecter of fate. I’ve never been able to plan four-and-a-half, three-and-a-half years ahead for certain.”Traditionally, there is no question as to whether a first-term president will run for reelection. Former President Donald Trump, for example, announced his plans to seek reelection on his first day in office. But questions about Biden’s 2024 intentions have swirled since even before his November victory — because of his age. At 78, Biden is the oldest person to assume the presidency.In office only two months, his 2024 plans have a direct effect on his political strength. If viewed as a one-term president, Biden would effectively be a lame duck with diminished sway at home and abroad as he pursues an aggressive agenda.Given a high-profile opportunity to clarify his status Thursday, he sought to create the impression he was not a lame duck, but he avoided making any definite promises.Should he run again, Biden said he “would fully expect” to choose Vice President Kamala Harris to be his running mate again. “She’s doing a great job. She’s a great partner,” he said.Biden seemed exasperated when asked if he expected Trump to run on the Republican side in four years.“I don’t even think about it. I have no idea,” Biden said, suggesting that Trump may not even be part of the Republican Party.It may seem early, but several Republican presidential prospects are already jockeying for position ahead of the GOP’s 2024 nomination fight.On Friday, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo plans to deliver a speech in Iowa, which traditionally holds the nation’s first presidential primary contest. Trump has teased another run, but he would be 78 himself at the beginning of the next president’s term.With a Democrat in the White House, there has been virtually no jockeying on the Democratic side so far. Harris would be the most likely successor should Biden step aside, but she would probably face competition. So soon after taking office, however, Harris’ allies have taken no steps to prepare for a presidential bid of her own.Privately, many Democrats believe Biden will not seek a second term. But publicly, there’s few willing to question his intentions.“He’s starting out by so far successfully improving our pandemic response both from a health perspective and economic perspective, which lays the groundwork for a successful term and reelection strategy,” said Democratic strategist Josh Schwerin. “He’s running.”ALSO READ | Biden doubles US vaccination goal to 200 million doses in first 100 days"

7d5778eba1d9a6b7bb1bff8530e4a9a8,"US President Donald Trump is eager to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin with full diplomatic bells and whistles when the two leaders visit Germany for G20 Summit next month. But the idea is exposing deep divisions within the administration on the best way to approach Moscow in the midst of an ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the US elections.Many administration officials believe the US needs to maintain its distance from Russia at such a sensitive time — and interact only with great caution. But Trump and some others within his administration have been pressing for a full bilateral meeting. He’s calling for media access and all the typical protocol associated with such sessions, even as officials within the State Department and National Security Council urge more restraint, according to a current and a former administration official.Some advisers have recommended that the president instead do either a quick, informal “pull-aside” on the sidelines of the summit, or that the U.S. and Russian delegations hold “strategic stability talks,” which typically don’t involve the presidents. The officials spoke anonymously to discuss private policy discussions.The contrasting views underscore differing views within the administration on overall Russia policy, and Trump’s eagerness to develop a working relationship with Russia despite the ongoing investigations.There are potential benefits to a meeting with Putin. A face-to-face meeting can humanize the two sides and often removes some of the intrigue involved in impersonal, telephone communication. Trump — the ultimate dealmaker — has repeatedly suggested that he can replace the Obama-era damage in the U.S.-Russia relationship with a partnership, particularly on issues like the ongoing Syria conflict."

""We were attacked. This was an attack. This wasn't just the flu by the way. Nobody has ever seen anything like this, 1917 was the last time,"" Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on Wednesday.He was responding to a question about the growing US national debt as a result of the multi-trillion dollars stimulus packages that his administration has come up with to help people and businesses in distress as a direct fallout of the pandemic.""We have no choice. Do we have a choice? I'm always concerned about everything. We had to fix this problem,"" he said.""We had the greatest economy in the history of the world... Better than China, better than any place,"" he said.""We built it in the last three years and then one day, they came and they said you have to close it. Now, we're going to open it again and we're going to be just as strong or stronger but you have to spend some money to get it back open,"" he said.“We saved our airlines. We saved numerous companies that are great companies that two months ago were having the best year they've ever had. Now all of a sudden, they're totally shut out of markets,” he added.Trump said the number of new positive cases continue to decline nationwide.""Recent hotspots appear to be stabilising. They are going in the right direction. Cases in the Boston area are now declining. The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific... Detroit has passed its peak,"" he said.""These trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen. That's very exciting,” he asserted.Trump said that his administration is working closely with governors to ensure that they have the testing infrastructure in place to reduce further spread of the virus if they're so inclined to use the testing apparatus, including strategies for older individuals, low income Americans, minorities, and Native Americans.“I'll not rest until that prosperity has been fully restored. I really believe that we're going to lift those numbers higher than ever before, and it will be as long as people might think,"" he said.""A lot of very smart people are looking at that and they're betting. You just have to look at what's going on with the stock market,” he added.The administration so far has directed more than $7 billion in federal funding to support the development of treatments, diagnostics, and therapies.The FDA, the NIH, and industry leaders are establishing master clinical trial protocols to test multiple promising new drugs at the same time.

Trump, a Republican, is being challenged by Biden in the November 3 elections.""In three days, we can put an end to a presidency that has divided this nation. In three days, we can put an end to a presidency that has failed to protect this nation. In three days, we can put an end to a presidency that has fanned the flames of hate all across this nation,” Biden said making a passionate appeal at a drive in car rally in Detroit, Michigan, a battleground State.Biden said he was quite confident this time that Americans would vote Trump out of power.“Millions of Americans have already voted. Millions more will vote in the days ahead. And my message to you is simple: The power to change this country is in your hands. I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries. There is nothing that is going to stop the people of this nation from voting,” he said.Asserting that when America votes, America will be heard, Biden said that when America is heard, he believes the message is going to be loud and clear.""It’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. We're done with the chaos. The tweets. The anger. The hate. The failure. The irresponsibility,"" said the former vice president, launching a scathing attack against Trump.“We've got a lot of work to do. And if I'm elected your president, we're going to do it. We’re going to act. We’re going to act to get COVID under control,” he said.Biden mocked at Trump, saying he was laughed by the world when spoke last time at the UN.“The President likes to portrays himself as a tough guy, a macho man. But when's the last time you saw the President of the United States literally being laughed at by world leaders when he spoke at the United Nations? When’s the last time you saw a President of the United States being openly mocked by our allies at a NATO conference?” he asked.""And can you believe we have a President who acts like Vladimir Putin’s puppy? Putin put bounties on the heads of American soldiers serving in Afghanistan and Trump was too scared to challenge him. Donald Trump is not strong. He's weak,” Biden charged.Alleging that Trump commands virtually no respect on the international stage, Biden said that this is a President who not only doesn’t understand sacrifice, he doesn’t understand the courage, the physical courage it takes to serve in uniform.Earlier in the day, he gave an identical speech in Flint, Michigan.“We have to vote to meet the climate crisis. Donald Trump calls it a hoax. I see it as jobs and health and safety,” he said.“The impacts of climate change too often fall disproportionately on communities of colour. We'll make sure these communities benefit from hundreds of billions in federal investments in infrastructure and climate change. That will create local jobs to rebuild roads, fill the sidewalk cracks, install broadband, and create spaces to live, work, and play safely,” he added.Biden said that it makes a gigantic difference, once volunteering.""That's how you win campaigns, every campaign that I've ever been in that I've won it's been the folks who've been doing everything from making the phone calls, to sending out the petitions to knocking on doors...I mean you make a gigantic difference,” he said."

0a84364f1c1927193683fc0943e1ae3e,"Representational ImageA bipartisan group of half a dozen influential American lawmakers has reintroduced important legislation in the House of Representatives which seeks to advance the US-India strategic relationship.If enacted, the legislation would ensure that the US State Department treat India as a NATO ally for the purposes of the Arms Export Control Act.It would send a powerful signal that defence sales to India should be prioritised according to US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, which had worked on this important legislation.The bill H R 2123 was introduced this week by Congressman Joe Wilson, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.""India is the world's largest democracy, a pillar of stability in the region, and has shown strong commitments to export control policies,"" said Wilson.""This adjustment to US law will further allow the US-India partnership to flourish in line with our security commitment to the Indo-Pacific region. I am grateful for the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), led by Dr Mukesh Aghi, and their support for this legislation,"" he said.The original co-sponsors of the legislation are Congressman Ami Bera — the longest serving Indian-American in Congress — and the House India Caucus Co-Chairs, Congressmen George Holding, Brad Sherman and Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Congressman Ted Yoho.The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal 2017 included special language recognising the unique US-India defence relationship that designated India as a ""Major Defence Partner"" of the United States.The language seeks unique consideration for trade and technology sharing with India and increased attention and support to advance this relationship in the areas of defence trade and technology sharing.""The legislation bolsters national security and helps ensure full alignment between the Department of Defence and the Department of State.""Such a change will institutionalise the gains made in the relationship and provide a more stable foundation upon which both countries can solidify this unique defence partnership,"" USISPF said.Although powerful in its own right, the NDAA FY 2017 has no legal bearing on the State Department's body of legislation, nor does it compel the State Department to view defence with India more favourably, USISPF said in a statement.To fulfil the spirit and intent of the NDAA 2017, the US-India Enhanced Cooperation Act would amend the Arms Export Control Act to put India on par with NATO allies and Israel, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia and Japan.""We applaud Congressman Wilson's leadership in reintroducing this important bill. We are confident the US Congress will continue to enact legislation that bolsters the bilateral. The great power competition is not lost on Members of Congress, who understand the strategic imperative for a deeper relationship with India,"" said Aghi, president and CEO of USISPF.""This legislation would be a major breakthrough for the US-India defense relationship. As Chairman of USISPF, I support this move because it would ultimately further strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries. The future is bright for the US-India relationship and we hope this legislation is enacted soon,"" USISPF chairman John Chambers said."

She always maintained her innocence, but has spent most of the past eight years in solitary confinement.""Aasia Bibi has left the country. She is a free person and travelled on her independent will,"" a source in the foreign office was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper.Bibi's counsel Saiful Malook confirmed that she has reached Canada, the Guardian reported. “It is a big day. Asia Bibi has left Pakistan and reached Canada. She has reunited with her family.

The judgement triggered protests across Pakistan with protestors led by Islamic political party Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan and other groups blocking major highways and roads in different parts of the country. The British Pakistani Christian Association too said in a statement that they had “received confirmation from a British diplomat that Aasia Bibi had safely exited Pakistan.”Geo News quoted sources as saying that the woman's documents were made a month ago. The Pakistan government had in November rejected reports claiming Aasia Bibi has fled abroad, saying the images on the social media showing the recently-acquitted Christian woman being greeted overseas are ""fake"". It was reported in local media that she was taken to Noor Khan Airbase Rawalpindi, from where she would be shifted to the Netherlands.Earlier, Italy had said it would help Bibi leave the country because her life was in danger following charges of blasphemy that put her on death row for eight years.Her husband had also urged the US president, and the UK and Canada premiers to help her leave the country for her life.Bibi's husband Ashiq Masih in a video message had appealed to the world leaders to help Aasia leave Pakistan for her safety."

The article can provide direction to the central and provincial governments.""Naseem, a leader of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), said, on the proposal of Article 149 (4) application, the headlines in newspapers that the federation wanted to take administrative charge of Karachi were wrong.""Some people have made me a hero while others a villain in Pakistan.

The government needs to understand what Farogh Naseem is trying to do,"" he said, adding: ""Devastation will spread in Karachi with the minister's remarks.""He said that the Supreme Court of Pakistan should take suo motu notice of the law minister's comments on Article 149.PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said that Foreign Minister Qureshi had commented without listening to Bilawal's statement, adding that the PPP chairperson had criticised the concepts of ""Sindhu desh"" and ""Pakhtunistan"".Karachi is the capital of Sindh province. It is the most populous city in Pakistan.

29faa186e6bde2a765ee2fab76060536,"UN chief warns of a world divided between US and ChinaU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned global leaders Tuesday of the looming risk of the world splitting in two, with the United States and China creating rival internets, currency, trade, financial rules “and their own zero-sum geopolitical and military strategies.”In his annual “state of the world address” to the General Assembly’s gathering of heads of state and government, Guterres said the risk “may not yet be large, but it is real.”“We must do everything possible to avert the great fracture and maintain a universal system, a universal economy with universal respect for international law; a multipolar world with strong multilateral institutions,” he told presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and ministers from the U.N.’s 193 member states.Guterres painted a grim picture of a deeply divided and anxious planet facing a climate crisis, “the alarming possibility of armed conflict in the Gulf,” spreading terrorism, rising populism and “exploding” inequality.His speech was followed by the traditional first speaker — Brazil, represented by its new president, Jair Bolsonaro — and the United States, represented by President Donald Trump.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is scheduled to speak later, said he was returning to London immediately afterward, where he will face the fallout of a court ruling against his decision to shut down Parliament over the is debating the U.K. in the crucial countdown to the country’s withdrawal from the European Union.The United Nations, designed to promote a multilateral world, has struggled in the face of increasing unilateralism by the U.S. and other nations that favor going it alone.Trump stressed in his speech that “love of our nations makes the world better for all nations.”“The future does not belong to globalists,” he said. “The future belongs to patriots.”Not so, said France’s President Emmanuel Macron, who disagreed with the American president and said the world’s problems cannot be solved by turning inwards.True patriotism, Macron said , “combines a love of one’s nation” with a multilateralism “based on real cooperation that strives to produce concrete results.”Said Guterres: “We are living in a world of disquiet.”“A great many people fear getting trampled, thwarted, left behind. Machines take their jobs. Traffickers take their dignity. Demagogues take their rights. Warlords take their lives. Fossil fuels take their future,” he said.Yet, the secretary-general said people still believe in “the spirit and ideas” of the United Nations and its foundation of multilateralism, of all countries working together.But he asked the VIP crowd in the horseshoe-shaped assembly chamber: “Do they believe leaders will put people first?”“We, the leaders must deliver for we, the peoples,” Guterres said.The global meeting unfolds against the backdrop of flaring tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, backed by its longtime ally, the United States. The Saudis say Iran was responsible for an attack earlier this month on two oil facilities in the kingdom, which Iran denies.The Trump administration has been engaged in an escalating series of harsh words and threats with Tehran. The U.S. has imposed increasingly crippling sanctions.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is scheduled to address world leaders on Wednesday.Guterres gave a dire warning about the situation in the Gulf.“Above all, we are facing the alarming possibility of armed conflict in the Gulf, the consequences of which the world cannot afford,” he said. “In a context where a minor miscalculation can lead to a major confrontation, we must do everything possible to push for reason and restraint.”Trump said the U.S. “does not seek conflict with any other nation” and desires peace, but “I will never fail to defend America’s interests.”He called Iran “the world’s No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism” and accused it of fueling wars in Syria and Yemen while squandering its wealth in a “fanatical quest” for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.“No responsible government should subsidize Iran’s bloodlust,” Trump said, warning that as long as Iran’s “menacing behaviour” continues, U.S. sanctions will be tightened.Guterres also warned that “outside interference” is making peace processes more difficult. And he pointed to unresolved conflicts from Yemen to Libya, Afghanistan and beyond.“A succession of unilateral actions threatens to torpedo a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine,” Guterres said. “In Venezuela, 4 million people have fled the country — one of the largest displacements in the world. Tensions are elevated in South Asia, where differences need to be addressed through dialogue.”France’s Macron appealed to world leaders to bring back the “courage” to make peace, especially in the Middle East.He urged the United States, Iran and countries in the region to resume negotiations, and the target should be that Iran never develops or acquire nuclear weapons, a solution to the conflict in Yemen, a regional security plan that includes securing navigation, and finally the lifting of economic sanctions.Tuesday’s opening session of the so-called General Debate followed three days of meetings focusing on the growing environmental threat to the planet.Guterres told leaders “what once was called ‘climate change’ is now truly a ‘climate crisis’ . and what was once called ‘global warming’ has more accurately become ‘global heating’.”While satellite data from the Brazilian Space Agency has shown a sharp increase in deforestation and forest fires in the past year, Bolsonaro told leaders: “The Amazon is not being devastated nor is it being consumed by fire as the media misleadingly says.”This year’s General Assembly session, which ends Sept. 30, has attracted world leaders from 136 of the 193 U.N. member nations, according to figures it released Friday. That large turnout reflects a growing global focus on addressing climate change and the perilous state of peace and security.Other countries will be represented by ministers and vice presidents — except Afghanistan, whose leaders are in a hotly contested presidential campaign ahead of Sept. 28 elections, and North Korea, which downgraded its representation from a minister to, likely, its U.N. ambassador. Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled plans to attend and are sending ministers.ALSO READ | PM Narendra Modi receives 'Global Goalkeeper' award for Swachch Bharat Abhiyan from Bill, Melinda GatesALSO READ | Imran Khan fails to garner global support over Kashmir, says Pakistan cannot attack IndiaALSO READ | UN research shows G20 nations lagging in climate action"

They spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.The Health Ministry announced that all of its hospitals in the capital were mobilized to treat the wounded.Maj. Gen. Tahsin al-Khafaji, spokesman for the Joint Operations Command, which includes an array of Iraqi forces, said the first suicide bomber cried out loudly that he was ill in the middle of the bustling market, prompting a crowd to gather around him — and that's when he detonated his explosive belt. The second detonated his belt shortly after, he said.“This is a terrorist act perpetrated by a sleeper cell of the Islamic State,” al-Khafaji said. He said IS “wanted to prove its existence"" after suffering many blows in military operations to root out the militants.The suicide bombings marked the first in three years to target Baghdad's bustling commercial area. A suicide bomb attack took place in the same area in 2018 shortly after then-Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi declared victory over the Islamic State group.No one immediately took responsibility for Thursday's attack, but Iraq has seen assaults perpetrated by both the Islamic State group and militia groups in recent months.Militias have routinely targeted the American presence in Iraq with rocket and mortar attacks, especially the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone. The pace of those attacks, however, has decreased since an informal truce was declared by Iran-backed armed groups in October.The style of Thursday's assault was similar to those IS has conducted in the past. But the group has rarely been able to penetrate the capital since being dislodged by Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition in 2017.IS has shown an ability to stage increasingly sophisticated attacks across northern Iraq, where it still maintains a presence, three years after Iraq declared victory over the group.Iraqi security forces are frequently ambushed and targeted with IEDs in rural areas of Kirkuk and Diyala. An increase in attacks was seen last summer as militants took advantage of the government's focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic.The twin bombings Thursday came days after Iraq's government unanimously agreed to hold early elections in October. Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi had announced in July that early polls would be held to meet the demands of anti-government protesters.Demonstrators took to the streets in the tens of thousands last year to demand political change, and an end to rampant corruption and poor services. More than 500 people were killed in mass demonstrations as security forces used live rounds and tear gas to disperse crowds.Iraq is also grappling with a severe economic crisis brought on by low oil prices that has led the government to borrow internally and risk depleting its foreign currency reserves. The Central Bank of Iraq devalued Iraq's dinar by nearly 20% last year to meet spending obligations."

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov briefly admitted that Russia had suffered a ""significant"" loss of its troops in Ukraine, calling the casualties ""a huge tragedy"" for the country in an interview with Sky News. ""We have significant losses of troops. It's a huge tragedy for us,"" said Peskov while replying to Russian losses. When asked about the Russian President ending up in a war crimes case, he said, ""No, he is not. We don't see any possibility for it."" In the latest move by the international community, Russia has been suspended from the Human Rights Council (HRC) in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in the General Assembly of the United Nations. The UN General Assembly suspended Russia from the Human Rights Council in a 93-24 vote, with 58 countries abstaining. Meanwhile, the European Union will commit a further 500 million euros (USD 543 million) in military support to Ukraine, European Commission President Charles Michel announced Thursday. The pledge takes the EU's military aid to Ukraine to a total of 1.5 billion euros (USD 1.63 billion) since Russia launched its invasion on February 24, he said in a tweet.The European Peace Facility, created in 2021, is an emergency fund of 5.69 billion euros that allows the EU to quickly finance military operations and ""preserve peace, prevent conflicts and strengthen international security,"" according to the EU. Moreover, The Kyiv Independent reported on Friday that the Sumy region is completely free of Russian forces.  "
dda190ddb50cda5ab82953bf10fa959e,"Tough mitigation measures is the way forward to contain COVID-19 in USThe US is dependent on tough mitigation measures, including social distancing and restricted movement, to stem the tide of the coronavirus pandemic, a top health expert has said as the number of COVID-19 infections in the country crossed 180,000 and fatalities surged past 3,800.President Donald Trump on Tuesday extended the social distancing measures for another 30 days till April 30 as the country is expected to face the peak in coronavirus cases around the middle of April.Despite best of the efforts by top American scientists and researchers, the US so far has not been able to come out with a vaccine for the deadly disease, the development of which normally takes years. The Trump Administration has accelerated the process, but it is still months away.“We are really convinced that mitigation is going to be doing the trick for us because what you have is you have an increase in new cases at a certain rate,” Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director and a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus told reporters at a White House News conference on Tuesday.Fauci insisted that mitigation is essential for the next 30 days in this fight against coronavirus. “When the increase in new cases begin to level off, the secondary effect is less hospitalizations, the next affect is less intensive care and the next affect is less deaths.""The deaths and the intensive care and the hospitalization always lagged behind that early indication that there are less new cases per day the way we saw in Italy and the way we are likely saying I don't want to jump the gun on it, we are seeing little inklings of this right now in New York,” Fauci said.White House officials and task force members asserted that mitigation and social distancing measures are the only way out to prevent the spread of the deadly virus, that it has been working and will work, despite that being painful and having its own toll on the American economy.The graphs presented by Deborah Birx, a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, showed that in states like California and Washington, which strictly implemented the mitigation measures including social distancing and lockdown-like situation, the spread of coronavirus was slow and these two states were able to keep the number of fatalities under control.Whereas in New York, it has skyrocketed in the absence of an early enforcement of such mitigation measures. “For whatever reason New York got off to a very late start and you see what happens when you get off to a late start. New Jersey got off to and I think both governors are doing an excellent job but they got off to a very late start,” Trump told reporters at the White House.“We all remember Washington State. It was just a month ago when they started to have the issues in Washington State, but they brought together their communities and their health providers, and they put in strong mitigation methods and testing. And you can see what the results in Washington State and California is. But without the content continuation for the next 30 days, anything could change,” Birx said.The mitigation steps taken by California and Washington State made the “big difference” as compared to New York and New Jersey, she said. Trump hoped that the implementation of mitigation measures till April 30 will be enough to contain the virus.“We're going to find out. We hope it's enough. We hope it's enough. We hope we're at a level where we can say let's go, because our country wants to get back to work. We really want to get back--everybody wants to get back to work,” he said. However, Fauci said that there could be a need of extending these measures if things are not under control by April 30.“After the 30 days, if we get the mitigation that we hope will get us to the suppression that Dr. Birx was talking about, there's a danger if we don't continue to maintain that that--where we have a resurgence right within the current outbreak,” he said.“That's sort of a second wave, but it really is an exacerbation of the current wave. We hope that doesn't happen, and that's why we're really pushing and why I was so emphatic about making sure we abide by those mitigation strategies,” Fauci said."

India has objected to the CPEC as it passes through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir, challenging Indian sovereignty.The CPEC is the flagship venture under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the pet project of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The BRI project, critics say, is saddling nations with debt.Zhang was accompanied by federal minister for maritime affairs Ali Zaidi and federal minister for economic affairs Hammad Azhar at the press meet. The COPHC and its four subsidiaries are responsible for operating the Gwadar seaport on the Arabian Sea and its economic zones for a period of 23 years.The concessions had been guaranteed in the Gwadar Port Concession Agreement but the successive governments in Islamabad were not notifying them, the paper noted.""I believe Gwadar will be the largest contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP) growth in seven years,"" said Zhang, adding that 95 per cent of the production in the Gwadar Free Zone would be exported.Currently, Karachi was the single largest contributor to the national economic output of Pakistan.""We have completed the master plan of the Gwadar Free Zone that will be built in four phases over a period of seven years,"" he said. ""Once the zone is fully developed in seven years, 47,000 jobs will be created for the locals, and its annual sales will be USD 1 billion.""On the troubles faced in reaching this point, the COPHC chairman said, ""Today is a big day and I had to struggle for seven years to secure these tax concessions, which had been promised in the Gwadar Port Concession Agreement.""I had been running up and down for seven years and everybody made promises but nobody helped,"" 23-year income tax holiday and exemptions of sales tax and customs duties,"" Zhang said.The Chinese company was lucky to get the support of the National Development Council – a joint civilian and military body – upon whose directions the obstacles were removed in obtaining these concessions, the report said.He also thanked the Pakistani military and media for their support to get these concessions notified.Minister for maritime affairs Zaidi vowed that the SEZs’ incentive package would be finalised soon, which remained pending for the last four years to the irritation of Chinese investors.In May 2017, Pakistan's Cabinet approved the Special Incentive Package for the Relocation of Industries from China for bringing Chinese investment in nine SEZs to be set up under the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The package had been developed on the demand of China that it made at the sixth meeting of the CPEC Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) held in Beijing in December 2016.The package was primarily aimed at those Chinese industrial units which were declared sunset industries by Beijing and had chances of being relocated to Pakistan, which might create hundreds of thousands of jobs.However, these incentives could not be notified due to differences over who would bear the cost – the federal or the provincial governments, the report said. ALSO READ | China praises Pakistani armed forces for preventing Chinese casualties in Gwadar hotel attack "

As of today, Italy's death toll stood at 29,315, bringing the total number of cases, including fatalities and recoveries, so far to 213,013, according to the latest data released by the country's Civil Protection Department. The Health authorities registered 98,467 active infections on Tuesday, down from 99,980 a day earlier, continuing the trend since April 20, when the country reported a drop in total active infections for the first time, Xinhua news agency reported.Of those infected, 1,427 are in intensive care, down by 52 compared to Monday, and 16,270 are hospitalized in normal wards, down by 553. The rest, or 82 per cent of those who tested positive, are in isolation at home.The total number of COVID-19 infections, fatalities and recoveries since the pandemic began has risen to 213,013.Italy entered into a national lockdown on March 10 to contain the pandemic. The lockdown was partly lifted on Monday as the country entered into the so-called ""Phase Two,"" involving the gradual resumption of social, economic and productive activities.Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte commented on the end of the lockdown in an interview with Affari Italiani (Italian Affairs), which he posted on Facebook on Tuesday.""Overall, the people of Italy have shown a great sense of responsibility,"" the prime minister said in reference to Monday, when millions went back to work and some economic sectors were allowed to reopen.""The resumption of manufacturing activities and construction took place in an orderly way,"" Conte said. ""The road ahead is still long, but Italy is starting up again.""Conte also commented that in spite of its initial disregard for Italy's plight as the first European country stricken by the pandemic, ""the European Union has shown it has understood the mistakes of the past.""""I am confident that both in terms of the economic response and of the battle against COVID-19, Europe will be up to this historic challenge,"" Conte said.With regards to US President Donald Trump's blaming of China for the virus, Conte said that ""right now we think the priority is to foster international cooperation as much as possible as an essential tool in order to defeat the virus and safeguard global health.""""Italy believes strongly in the possibility of this cooperation and is ready to make its contribution,"" the prime minister said.In a report out Tuesday, National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) said that ""over the course of just five weeks"", the pandemic has triggered a ""sudden and vertical collapse"" in the airline industry.In Italy as of 2017, this industry had a turnover of 9.4 billion euros (US $10.2 billion) and employed about 20,000 people, while a total of 193 million passengers transited through Italy's airports in 2019 (up by 7.4 million compared to 2018), according to ISTAT.""While the spread of COVID-19 has halted transportation almost completely, the sector that suffered the strongest impact was air passenger transport,"" ISTAT analysts wrote.""The COVID-19 emergency has brutally interrupted the positive evolution of this sector, plunging it into a dramatic global crisis of unprecedented proportions over a very brief period of time,"" ISTAT wrote.In March this year, 66.3 per cent of flights were cancelled, and passengers dropped by 85 per cent (from about 14 million in March 2019 to just over 2 million in March this year).ISTAT also reported that the number of passengers arriving and departing from Italy's airports dropped from just under 460,000 on February 23 to 6,780 on March 29.(With Inputs from IANS)ALSO READ | US COVID-19 deaths top 70,000, cases top 1.2 millionALSO READ | Worldwide coronavirus cases cross 3.7-million mark; death toll at 258,294"
7f389807f8228309605d6455b22bfbd9,"Joe Biden makes all adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccine on April 19US President Joe Biden has announced that he is bumping up his deadline by two weeks for states to make all adults in the US eligible for coronavirus vaccines. But even as he expressed optimism about the pace of vaccinations, he warned Americans that the nation is not yet out of the woods when it comes to the pandemic.""Let me be deadly earnest with you: We aren't at the finish line. We still have a lot of work to do. We are still in a life and death race against this virus,"" Biden said in remarks at the White House.The president warned that ""new variants of the virus are spreading and they are moving quickly. Cases are going back up, hospitalizations are no longer declining.” He added that ""the pandemic remains dangerous,"" and encouraged Americans to continue to wash their hands, socially distance and wear masks.Biden added that while his administration is on schedule to meet his new goal of distributing 200 million doses of the vaccine during his first 100 days, it will still take time for enough Americans to get vaccinated to slow the spread of the virus. But he expressed hope that his Tuesday (April 6) announcement, that every adult will be eligible by April 19 to sign up and get in a virtual line to be vaccinated, will help expand access and distribution of the vaccine. Some states already had begun moving up their deadlines from the original May 1 goal.""No more confusing rules. No more confusing restrictions,"" Biden said.Biden made the announcement after visiting a COVID-19 vaccination site at Immanuel Chapel at Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria. During his visit, he thanked everyone for administering the shots and for showing up to receive them.""That's the way to beat this,"" Biden said. ""Get the vaccination when you can.""The president also said no one should fear mutations of the coronavirus that are showing up in the US after being discovered in other countries. He acknowledged that the new strains are more virulent and more dangerous, but said ""the vaccines work on all of them.""Biden also announced that 150 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been shot into arms since his inauguration on January 20. That puts the president well on track to meet his new goal of 200 million shots administered by his 100th day in office on April 30.Biden's original goal had been 100 million shots by the end of his first 100 days, but that number was reached in March. Still, he acknowledged Tuesday that his administration fell short of its goal to deliver at least one shot to every teacher, school staff member and childcare worker during the month of March, to try to accelerate school reopenings.Biden announced the target early last month and directed federal resources toward achieving it, but said Tuesday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that about 80 per cent of teachers, school staff and childcare workers had received a shot. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, also spent the day Tuesday focused on promoting the COVID-19 vaccine, each touring a vaccination center, Harris in Chicago and Emhoff in Yakima, Washington.Harris praised the workers and those receiving their vaccine at a site set up at a local union hall, and spoke of spring as ""a moment where we feel a sense of renewal"".""We can see a light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.Some states are making plans to ease their health restrictions, even as the country is facing a potential new surge in virus cases. On Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned that the country is in a ""critical time"" because ""we could just as easily swing up into a surge.""""That would be a setback for public health, but that would be a psychological setback, too,"" he said during an interview with the National Press Club. He noted that Americans are experiencing ""COVID-19 fatigue"" after more than a year of lockdowns and restrictions to public life aimed at slowing the spread of the virus.Biden and many of his advisers have warned against reopening the economy too quickly and easing mask mandates, at the risk of driving a fresh surge in virus cases.""We just don't want to have to go back to really shutting things down. That would be terrible,"" Fauci said.But Biden's announcement of the April 19 deadline was aimed at injecting optimism into a public that's grown weary of the restrictions, and it comes as a flood of vaccine is being sent to states this week. Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus coordinator, told governors Tuesday during a weekly conference call that more than 28 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines will be delivered to states this week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced at her daily briefing.That allocation brings the total amount of vaccine distributed over the past three weeks to more than 90 million doses, Psaki said. At least a dozen states opened eligibility to anyone 16 and older on Monday alone, while New Jersey and Oregon announced this week that all residents 16 and older will become eligible on April 19.The president had announced just last week that 90 per cent of adults would be eligible for one of three approved COVID-19 vaccines by April 19, in addition to having a vaccination site within 5 miles of their home.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_5133676501 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/01/0_w619hjle/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_w619hjle_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""All myths and rumors on coronavirus vaccine decoded "", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""457"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_5133676501 = ''; jwsetup_5133676501(); function jwsetup_5133676501() { jwvidplayer_5133676501 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_5133676501"").setup(jwconfig_5133676501); jwvidplayer_5133676501.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_5133676501, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_w619hjle\"", ns_st_pr=\""All myths and rumors on coronavirus vaccine decoded\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""All myths and rumors on coronavirus vaccine decoded\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""All myths and rumors on coronavirus vaccine decoded\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-01-29\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-01-29\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/01/0_w619hjle/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_5133676501.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_5133676501.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_5133676501.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_5133676501.stop(); jwvidplayer_5133676501.remove(); jwvidplayer_5133676501 = ''; jwsetup_5133676501(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_5133676501.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_5133676501.stop(); jwvidplayer_5133676501.remove(); jwvidplayer_5133676501 = ''; jwsetup_5133676501(); return; }); jwvidplayer_5133676501.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_5133676501.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_5133676501.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_5133676501.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_5133676501.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_5133676501.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

The statement comes a day after India said the second consular access to Jadhav was ""neither meaningful nor credible"". Earlier on Thursday, Pakistan provided second consular access to Jadhav, a 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, who was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. The Indian government said the second access was ""neither meaningful nor credible,"" and Jadhav appeared visibly under stress.External Affairs Ministry said that the consular officers were not given unimpeded, unhindered, and unconditional access"" to Jadhav.

If India wants another access then our offer is open. If they (India) want to meet him tonight or tomorrow, we are ready,” the paper quoted Qureshi as telling a news channel.However, there was no official confirmation neither from India nor from Pakistan whether the decision was conveyed to New Delhi.India approached the International Court of Justice against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July last year that Pakistan must undertake an ""effective review and reconsideration"" of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.The first consular access under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 was earlier provided by Pakistan on September 2 last year.Though Pakistan Foreign ministry had assured India that the consular access on Thursday would be unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional, it turned out that the arrangements of the meeting were not in accordance with the assurances made by Islamabad, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Srivastava said.Pakistan claims that its security forces arrested Jadhav from the restive Balochistan province on March 3, 2016 after he reportedly entered from Iran. India maintains that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy.(With PTI inputs)"
d4ca6c87a18a0adc6be5eaf2b949e038,"'Slip of tongue': Pak minister on Imran Khan's 'Osama bin Laden a martyr' commentOne year after Prime Minister Imran Khan described slain Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden as a ""shaheed"" (martyr), Pakistan's information minister on Sunday clarified that it was a ""slip of the tongue"" by his boss.Speaking in Parliament on June 25 last year, Khan said the American forces entered Pakistan and killed bin Laden without informing the government after which everyone started abusing his country.""I don't think there's a country which supported the war on terror and had to face embarrassment for it. Pakistan was also openly blamed for US' failure in Afghanistan,"" Khan had said.""For Pakistanis across the globe, it was an embarrassing moment when the Americans came and killed Osama bin Laden at Abottabad...martyred him. The whole world started abusing us after that. Our ally came inside our country and killed someone without informing us. And, 70,000 Pakistanis died because of US' war on terror,"" he told lawmakers, drawing criticism from the Opposition as well as from the media.Bin Laden, then the world's most wanted terrorist, was killed by US Navy Seals in a covert military operation in the Pakistani garrison city of Abbottabad in May, 2011.Speaking on Geo News programme Jirga, aired on Sunday, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said, ""It was a slip of the tongue. He had clarified it,"" the minister said while referring to Khan's controversial remarks.The controversy surfaced again last week when Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi refrained from calling Osama bin Laden a terrorist in an interview with Afghanistan’s Tolo News.When the interviewer quoted Prime Minister Imran as calling bin Laden a “martyr”, Qureshi said: “Well, again. Out of context. He (the PM) was quoted out of context. And, a particular section of the media pair it up.”Asked if he would disagree, the foreign minister paused for a while and then said: “I will let it pass,” the Dawn newspaper reported.The leading Pakistani in an editorial noted that Qureshi's refusal to call bin Laden a terrorist in an interview with an Afghan media outlet is perplexing and defies logic.""There are times to be diplomatic and parry sticky questions. However, this certainly didn’t appear to be one of those instances,"" the Dawn said.""Mr Qureshi could have used this opportunity to clearly state that Pakistan considers the late Al Qaeda mastermind a terrorist. However, his non-committal comments sent the wrong message to a global audience,"" it pointed out.""Pakistan’s top leadership needs to be absolutely clear when it comes to describing fighters like bin Laden,"" the editorial stressed.When asked about Qureshi's remarks by Tolo News anchor, Information Minister Chaudhry said the foreign minister's refusal to call bin Laden a terrorist might have had to do with his desire to ""move forwards, instead of looking at the past"".The information minister said a clarification had been issued last year by Prime Minister Imran's spokesperson after his remarks. He emphasised that Pakistan had rendered the most sacrifices in the war against terrorism.""Our position is entirely clear,"" the senior leader of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) said, adding that ""when our own media exaggerate things then, of course, the foreign [media] will pick them up from local sources.""ALSO READ | Pak calls PM Modi's meeting with J&K political leaders as 'PR exercise'ALSO READ | Embarrassment for Imran Khan as Pakistan remains on FATF's grey list"

Issues related to the two are expected to figure in the Home Secretary's meetings, they said. Mehrishi is expected to hold talks with his counterpart Patsy Wilkinson, the second permanent secretary in the British Home Office, and put forward India's case. India has already assured Britain of all assistance in extradition matters to allow the Crown Prosecution Services (CPS) to present water-tight cases before the courts there against Mallya. During his meeting with May in Hamburg, PM Modi had sought Britain’s cooperation to bring back economic offenders including Mallya and Lalit. Mallya has been in Britain for over a year, escaping arrest warrants against him, while a court in London is also hearing a case regarding his return to India. Mallya, who is wanted in India for Kingfisher Airlines default on loans worth nearly Rs 9,000 crore, has been in Britain since March 2016. In April, he went to a central London police station, was arrested and released on conditional bail a few hours later after providing a bail bond worth 650,000 pounds. He assured the court that he would abiding by all conditions associated with extradition proceedings, such as the surrender of his passport. Lalit Modi, former chief of the Indian Premier League (IPL), is wanted by the Indian authorities with respect to a money laundering probe and is said to be in the UK. The former cricket administrator has maintained that he has not done any wrong in any of the IPL deals. The Enforcement Directorate had registered a money laundering case against Modi and others based on a Chennai police complaint in 2012 on charges of alleged cheating of BCCI-IPL in granting the overseas telecast rights of the T-20 cricket tournament in 2009. India and Britain have an extradition treaty, signed in 1992, but so far only one extradition has taken place under the arrangement -- that of Samirbhai Vinubhai Patel. Patel was sent back to India last October to face a trial in connection with his involvement in the post-Godhra riots of 2002. The Home Secretary is also expected to discuss with British officials how to enhance cooperation in matters of terrorism, intelligence sharing and checking activities of Khalistan supporters. With PTI Inputs"

e0bc4f5970555798fda8a5a2e819ad8f,"A woman walks by a house destroyed while her village was occupied by Russian troops in Andriivka, Ukraine, Tuesday, April 5, 2022.The UN General Assembly will vote on Thursday (April 7) on whether to suspend Russia from the U.N.’s premier human rights body. The move was initiated by the United States in response to the discovery of hundreds of bodies after Russian troops withdrew from towns near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, sparking calls for its forces to be tried for war crimes.U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the call for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council in the wake of videos and photos of streets in the town of Bucha strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians. The videos and reporting from the town have sparked global revulsion and calls for tougher sanctions on Russia, which has vehemently denied responsibility.“We believe that the members of the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine, and we believe that Russia needs to be held accountable,” Thomas-Greenfield said Monday. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce.”General Assembly spokeswoman Paulina Kubiak said Wednesday the assembly’s emergency special session on Ukraine will resume at 10 a.m. EDT on Thursday when the resolution “to suspend the rights of membership in the Human Rights Council of the Russian Federation” will be put to a vote.Also Read: After Bucha killings, US targets Putin's daughters and Russian banks in new sanctionsWhile the Human Rights Council is based in Geneva, its members are elected by the 193-nation General Assembly for three-year terms. The March 2006 resolution that established the Human Rights Council states that the assembly may suspend membership rights of a country “that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.”The brief resolution to be voted on expresses “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, particularly at the reports of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation, including gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights.”To be approved, the resolution requires a two-thirds majority of assembly members that vote “yes” or “no.” Abstentions don’t count.The General Assembly voted 140-5 with 38 abstentions on March 24 on a resolution blaming Russia for the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and urging an immediate cease-fire and protection for millions of civilians and the homes, schools and hospitals critical to their survival.The vote was almost exactly the same as for the March 2 resolution the assembly adopted demanding an immediate Russian cease-fire, withdrawal of all its forces and protection for all civilians. That vote was 141-5 with 35 abstentions.Thomas-Greenfield said Monday that her message to the 140 members who voted in favor of those two resolutions to support Russia’s suspension from the Human Rights Council is simple: “The images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us now to match our words with action.”“We cannot let a member state that is subverting every principle we hold dear to continue to sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council,” she said.Supporters of the resolution are optimistic about its approval, though not necessarily with the support of 140 countries.Russia asked an unspecified number of countries to vote “no,” saying an abstention or not voting would be considered unfriendly and would affect bilateral relations.In its so-called “non-paper” obtained by The Associated Press, Russia said the attempt to expel it from the Human Rights Council is political and being supported by various countries to preserve their dominant position and control over the world and continue “the politics of neo-colonialism of human rights” in international relations.Russia said its priority Is to promote and defend human rights, including multilaterally in the Human Rights Council.Russia’s ambassador in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, called the U.S. action “unfounded and purely emotional bravado that looks good on camera -- just how the U.S. likes it.”“Washington exploits the Ukrainian crisis for its own benefit in an attempt either to exclude or suspend Russia from international organizations,” Gatilov said, in comments relayed by a Russian diplomatic mission spokesman.Russia and the other four veto-wielding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council- Britain, China, France, and the United States- all currently have seats on the Human Rights Council, which the U.S. rejoined this year.The only country to have its membership rights stripped at the council was Libya in 2011, when upheaval in the North African country brought down longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi, said council spokesman Rolando Gomez.No permanent member of the Security Council has ever had its membership revoked from any U.N. body. Also Read: Russia-Ukraine War: Heartbreaking image of dog sitting beside his dead master's corpse goes viral"

The study led by researchers from the New York University, US, showed that the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccination worked well against the majority of variants as the earlier virus, but the vaccine neutralised the South African variant and the Brazil variant with a 3-fold decrease in titer.""Our interpretation of the results is that the vaccine antibodies are very powerful, and even if you lose 3-fold of the titer, there is still plenty of antibody there to neutralize the virus. We believe the findings demonstrate that the vaccines will remain protective against the variants that we tested,"" said Nathaniel ""Ned"" Landau, Professor in the Department of Microbiology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, in New York City.The study, published in the journal mBio, also found that monoclonal antibody cocktail consisting of casirivamab and imdevimab might be less effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants in laboratory experiments.Lab experiments on Regeneron pharmaceuticals' REGN-COV2 -- a 2 recombinant monoclonal antibody cocktail -- showed that casirivamab had lost some of its neutralising activity against the South African and Brazilian variants and the cocktail was 9- to 15-fold decreased in titer, the team said.""One of the Regeneron antibodies is affected by the E484K mutation, and as a result the cocktail loses some of its neutralizing activity,"" said Landau.""The question with this work is 'how do the laboratory findings translate into clinical effects, that is what will happen when you treat a patient infected with one of the variants?' We cannot say for sure. We will only know when the clinical data comes in,"" Landau noted.The team created a panel of pseudotyped viruses using the spike proteins from six different variants of SARS-CoV-2: the B117 lineage variant identified in the UK, the B1351 lineage variant identified in South Africa, the B11248 lineage variant identified in Brazil, the COH.20G/677H lineage variant identified in Columbus Ohio, the 20 EUs variant identified in Spain and later found elsewhere in Europe, and the Mink cluster five spike proteins located in minks in Denmark.Similar experiments in Moderna's Covid vaccine also produced the same results, Landau said.ALSO READ | Pfizer, Moderna vaccines can reduce COVID risk by 91 per cent: US CDCALSO READ | US to buy 500M Pfizer vaccines to share globally"

The insurgents say they met Khalilzad in Qatar last month.Khalilzad arrived in the region last Thursday and will return to Washington on Nov 20."
9530583c00ec528249b0d900da642788,"As China quarantines Wuhan, Coronavirus death toll rises to 25; over 800 cases reportedThe mysterious new strain of Coronavirus has now resulted in a total of 25 deaths in China with over 830 reported cases. The Chinese National Health Commission (CNHC) confirmed the rise in the death toll because of the epidemic outbreak. Even as the country quarantines Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, there seems no respite from the virus that has resulted in major filtration and screening at airports around the globe with incoming travellers from China.""As of 24:00 on 23 January, the National Health Commission has received a total of 830 confirmed cases of new Coronavirus infection in 29 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), including 177 severe cases and 25 deaths, including 24 cases in Hubei Province and one case in Hebei Province"", the CNHC statement said.As per reports, over 8,000 people have been kept under medical observation.A tweet by CCTV Asia Pacific shows the streets of Wuhan with only a handful of pedestrians and vehicles as locals chose to stay at home despite the festive season in China. The government has also announced the cancelation of the Chinese New Year celebration amidst the unprecedented pneumonia outbreak. The World Health Organization has decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency, a step that can bring more money and resources to fight a threat but that can also cause trade and travel restrictions and other economic damage, making the decision a politically fraught one.The decision “should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we’re not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.”Chinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns of the cities will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China’s Communist Party-led government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people’s liberties. And the effectiveness of such measures is unclear.“To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,” said Gauden Galea, the WHO″s representative in China. “It has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.”Jonathan Ball, a professor of virology at molecular virology at the University of Nottingham in Britain, said the lockdowns appear to be justified scientifically.“Until there’s a better understanding of what the situation is, I think it’s not an unreasonable thing to do,” he said. “Anything that limits people’s travels during an outbreak would obviously work.”But Ball cautioned that any such quarantine should be strictly time-limited. He added: “You have to make sure you communicate effectively about why this is being done. Otherwise you will lose the goodwill of the people.”Image Source : APAs China quarantines Wuhan, Coronavirus death toll rises to 25; over 800 cases reportedAs China quarantines Wuhan, Coronavirus death toll rises to 25; over 800 cases reportedDuring the devastating West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014, Sierra Leone imposed a national three-day quarantine as health workers went door to door, searching for hidden cases. Burial teams collecting corpses and people taking the sick to Ebola centers were the only ones allowed to move freely. Frustrated residents complained of food shortages.In China, the illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub. Local authorities demanded all residents wear masks in public places and urged civil servants wear them at work.After the city was closed off Thursday, images showed long lines and empty shelves at supermarkets, as people stocked up. Trucks carrying supplies into the city are not being restricted, although many Chinese recall shortages in the years before the country’s recent economic boom.Analysts predicted cases will continue to multiply, although the jump in numbers is also attributable in part to increased monitoring.“Even if (cases) are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,” the WHO’s Galea said, adding, however, that the number of infected is not an indicator of the outbreak’s severity so long as the death rate remains low.The coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which is thought to have originated from camels.China is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of SARS. For months, even after the illness had spread around the world, China parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid WHO experts. This time, China has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and President Xi Jinping has emphasized that as a priority.Health authorities are taking extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the virus, placing those believed infected in plastic tubes and wheeled boxes, with air passed through filters.The first cases in the Wuhan outbreak were connected to people who worked at or visited a seafood market, now closed for an investigation. Experts suspect that the virus was first transmitted from wild animals but that it may also be mutating. Mutations can make it deadlier or more contagious.Also Read | Coronavirus: Confusion clears over 'infected' Indian nurse in Saudi Arabia   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_1651873316 = { ""file"": ""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_inxefer9_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_inxefer9_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Closely monitoring situation: Health Secretary on coronavirus"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_1651873316 = ''; jwsetup_1651873316(); function jwsetup_1651873316() { jwvidplayer_1651873316 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_1651873316"").setup(jwconfig_1651873316); jwvidplayer_1651873316.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_1651873316, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_inxefer9\"", ns_st_pr=\""Closely monitoring situation: Health Secretary on coronavirus\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Closely monitoring situation: Health Secretary on coronavirus\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Closely monitoring situation: Health Secretary on coronavirus\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2020-01-22\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2020-01-22\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_inxefer9_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_1651873316.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_1651873316.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_1651873316.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_1651873316.stop(); jwvidplayer_1651873316.remove(); jwvidplayer_1651873316 = ''; jwsetup_1651873316(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_1651873316.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_1651873316.stop(); jwvidplayer_1651873316.remove(); jwvidplayer_1651873316 = ''; jwsetup_1651873316(); return; }); jwvidplayer_1651873316.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1651873316.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1651873316.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1651873316.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1651873316.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1651873316.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

It is not a man-made accident. I noticed that authorised Indian professionals have made an analysis and clarified,"" she said, referring to reports of the lakes being detected by satellites.""We hope the Indian media will not make a groundless speculation on this,"" she said.She said the Chinese officials concerned will maintain communication with the Indian side on the issue.Earlier, China had refuted reports that the highly-polluted water in the Siang river was caused by attempts to build a massive tunnel to divert the water to neighbouring arid Xinjiang region.The issue was reportedly discussed during the recent 20th border talks between NSA Ajit Doval and Chinese State Councillor, Yang Jiechi on December 22 in Delhi.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488 km long Line of Actual Control (LAC).

""I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second,"" Markle said in a piece for the New York Times. The former actress and Prince Harry's wife said that it took place one July morning when she was caring for Archie, the couple's son. She said losing a child meant ""carrying an almost unbearable grief experienced by many but talked about by few"". ""In the pain of our loss, my husband and I discovered that in a room of 100 women, 10 to 20 of them will have suffered from miscarriage,"" Markle said, adding that despite the staggering commonality of this pain, the conversation remains taboo, riddled with (unwarranted) shame, and perpetuating a cycle of solitary mourning.“In being invited to share our pain, together we take the first steps toward healing.”Beginning to describe how tragedy struck on a “morning that began as ordinarily as any other day: Make breakfast. Feed the dogs. Take vitamins. Find that missing sock. Pick up the rogue crayon that rolled under the table. Throw my hair in a ponytail before getting my son from his crib.“After changing his diaper, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right.”Later, she said, she “lay in a hospital bed, holding my husband’s hand. I felt the clamminess of his palm and kissed his knuckles, wet from both our tears. Staring at the cold white walls, my eyes glazed over. I tried to imagine how we’d heal.”READ MORE: Internet finds Meghan Markle's doppelganger.

4add775a8f9e11036c0e4163a804cba8,"President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives at Sacramento McClellan Airport, in McClellan Park, Calif., Monday, Sept. 14, 2020, for a briefing on wildfires. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)With the smell of California wildfires in the air, President Donald Trump on Monday ignored the scientific consensus that climate change is playing a central role in historic West Coast infernos and renewed his unfounded claim that failure to rake forest floors and clear dead timber is mostly to blame.The fires are threatening to become another front in Trump’s reelection bid, which is already facing hurdles because of the coronavirus pandemic, joblessness and social unrest. His Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, in his own speech Monday said the destruction and mounting death toll across California, Oregon and Washington require stronger presidential leadership and labeled Trump a “climate arsonist.”Trump traveled to Northern California to be briefed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state and federal officials. At one point, state Natural Resources Agency Secretary Wade Crowfoot urged the president to “recognize the changing climate and what it means to our forests.”“If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,” Crowfoot added.Trump responded, “It will start getting cooler, just you watch.”Crowfoot politely pushed back that he wished the science agreed with the president. Trump countered, “I don’t think science knows, actually.”That striking moment came on a day of dueling campaign events, with Trump and Biden dramatically contrasting their outlooks on climate change — and the impact it has had on the record-setting fires ravaging the West Coast.Trump’s suggestion that the planet is going to start to unexpectedly cool is at odds with reality, experts say.“Maybe there is a parallel universe where a pot on the stove with the burner turned to high ‘starts getting cooler.’ But that is not our universe,” said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field.Biden lashed at Trump, saying the moment requires “leadership, not scapegoating” and that “it’s clear we are not safe in Donald Trump’s America.”“This is another crisis, another crisis he won’t take responsibility for,” Biden said. He said that if voters give “a climate denier” another four years in the White House, “why would we be surprised that we have more of America ablaze?”Trump, who was briefed during a stop near Sacramento before a campaign visit to Phoenix, had been mostly quiet as the catastrophe on the West Coast has unfolded over the past few weeks. He tweeted appreciation of firefighters and emergency responders on Friday, the first public comments he had made in weeks about the fires that have killed dozens, burned millions of acres and forced thousands from their homes.The president arrived at at Sacramento McClellan Airport to the powerful scent of smoke from the fires burning some 90 miles away.He contended anew that Democratic state leaders are to blame for failing to rake leaves and clear dead timber from forest floors. Trump offered no evidence to support his claim, and wildfire experts and forest managers say raking leaves makes no sense for vast U.S. wilderness and forests. And many of the blazes have roared through coastal chaparral and grasslands, not forest.“When you have years of leaves, dried leaves on the ground, it just sets it up,” Trump said. “It’s really a fuel for a fire. So they have to do something about it.”University of Colorado fire scientist Jennifer Balch called Trump’s deflecting blame on forest managers “infuriating.”“It’s often hard to know what Trump means,” Balch added. “If by forest management he means clear-cutting, that’s absolutely the wrong solution to this problem. ... There’s no way we’re going to log our way out of this fire problem.”Biden, who gave his climate speech in Delaware on Monday, released a $2 trillion plan in July to boost investment in clean energy and stop all climate-damaging emissions from U.S. power plants by 2035.But as the wildfires rage, some climate activists have expressed frustration that Biden has not been more forceful on the issue. He has not embraced, for instance, some of the most progressive elements of the Green New Deal.To that end, Biden in his address did not wade into political and policy disagreements among Democrats, progressive activists and even some Republicans who acknowledge the climate crisis. As he has before, Biden sought to frame his energy proposals as an immediate necessity and a long-term economic boon focusing more on new jobs and a cleaner economy that would offset any initial costs.“Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have caused these fires and hurricanes,” Biden said. “But if he gets a second term, these hellish events will continue to become more common and more devastating and more deadly.”Trump visited McClellan Park, a former U.S. Air Force Base about 10 miles outside Sacramento that is used by firefighters as a staging area for large aircraft used in combating blazes. Most of the largest firefighting aircraft have not been utilized in recent days due to heavy smoke limiting visibility.Biden’s running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, will return to her home state Tuesday to meet with emergency service personnel to be briefed on the state’s wildfires.In 2015, Trump stated bluntly: “I’m not a believer in global warming, I’m not a believer in man-made global warming.” After the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report concluded climate change would hurt the economy, Trump said he read it but didn’t believe it. In September 2019, he falsely slammed the Green New Deal as an effort that would lead to “No more cows. No more planes ... no more people, right?”Climate scientists say rising heat and worsening droughts in California consistent with climate change have expanded what had been the state’s autumn wildfire season to year-round, sparking bigger, deadlier and more frequent fires.All five of the state’s largest fires in history have raged in the past three years, including the deadliest fire, a 2018 blaze that killed 85 people when it swept through the town of Paradise on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada. Trump during his Monday visit awarded seven members of the California National Guard the Distinguished Flying Cross for the rescue of dozens of Californians during the 2018 Paradise fires.An analysis out in August from Stanford climate and wildfire researcher Michael Goss and others found that a nearly 2-degree (1 Celsius) rise in autumn temperatures and 30 percent drop in rainfall has more than doubled the number of autumn days with extreme fire weather over the past 40 years."

d32d53a6f12874f7e2e5d28b5e4222cb,"Coronavirus claims 1,016 lives in China so far; over 40,000 cases reportedThe deadly coronavirus continues to infect China as the death toll has crossed 1,000 in the country. Tuesday recorded more than 100 fatalities - maximum deaths in a single day, which pushed the death toll to 1,016 in mainland China. Despite the official end of the extended Lunar New Year holiday, China remained mostly closed for business as many remained at home, with some 60 million people under virtual quarantine. A total of 42,638 virus infections have been recorded on the Chinese mainland. As the situation continues to worsen, the World Health Organization has announced a new name for the disease COVID-19, saying officials wanted to avoid stigmatizing any geographic location, group of people or animal that might be linked to the disease and to make it clear it was a new coronavirus discovered in 2019. “Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, adding that the name was agreed upon by officials at WHO, the World Organization for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization. While no central government-level officials have lost their jobs, state media reported Tuesday that the top health officials in Hubei province, home to the epicenter of Wuhan, have been relieved of their duties.No reasons were given, although the province’s initial response was deemed slow and ineffective. Speculation that higher-level officials could be sacked has simmered, but doing so could spark political infighting and be a tacit admission that the Communist Party dropped the ball. The virus outbreak has become the latest political challenge for Xi Jinping, who despite accruing more political power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, has struggled to handle crises on multiple fronts. These include a sharply slowing domestic economy, the trade war with the US and push-back on China’s increasingly aggressive foreign policies.Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, authorities evacuated some residents of an apartment block after two cases among those living there raised suspicion that the virus may be spreading through the building’s plumbing.It was reminiscent of the SARS outbreak that killed hundreds in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. The biggest number of connected cases in that outbreak were in one apartment complex where the virus spread through sewage pipes.Health officials called it a precautionary measure after a 62-year-old woman diagnosed with the virus Tuesday was found living 10 floors below a man who was earlier confirmed infected. The woman’s son and daughter-in-law, who live with her, were among seven new cases reported last week in the city, where a total of 49 people have been infected.The 34 households evacuated live above or below the woman and share the same sewage system. A modified toilet drainage pipe in her unit may have helped spread the virus and officials are checking if any other units have made such alterations while they disinfect the building.Also Read | WHO names coronavirus as “COVID-19”Also Read | Mother infected with coronavirus in China gives birth to a healthy baby​   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_3053065878 = { ""file"": ""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_7lzkat74_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_7lzkat74_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Coronavirus: Over 1000 dead in mainland China, 2,097 new confirmed cases"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_3053065878 = ''; jwsetup_3053065878(); function jwsetup_3053065878() { jwvidplayer_3053065878 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_3053065878"").setup(jwconfig_3053065878); jwvidplayer_3053065878.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_3053065878, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_7lzkat74\"", ns_st_pr=\""Coronavirus: Over 1000 dead in mainland China, 2,097 new confirmed cases\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Coronavirus: Over 1000 dead in mainland China, 2,097 new confirmed cases\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Coronavirus: Over 1000 dead in mainland China, 2,097 new confirmed cases\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2020-02-11\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2020-02-11\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_7lzkat74_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_3053065878.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_3053065878.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_3053065878.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_3053065878.stop(); jwvidplayer_3053065878.remove(); jwvidplayer_3053065878 = ''; jwsetup_3053065878(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_3053065878.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_3053065878.stop(); jwvidplayer_3053065878.remove(); jwvidplayer_3053065878 = ''; jwsetup_3053065878(); return; }); jwvidplayer_3053065878.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_3053065878.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_3053065878.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_3053065878.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_3053065878.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_3053065878.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  ​"
3370d46008a8c08eddfade95b4e14fad,"UN headquarters preparing for three-phase reopening to 'new normal' amid COVID-19The sprawling United Nations headquarters, which has remained largely closed since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is preparing to re-open in three phases with new workplace measures being put in place for staff, diplomats and journalists that will include maximum two-person occupancy in elevators and wearing masks in common areas.As New York City begins the first phase of reopening from Monday, the UN is also gearing up for its return to normalcy in three phases.New York, the US city worst-hit by the coronavirus, has reported 211,728 cases and 21,323 deaths. The US has over 1.94 million infections and at least 110,400 have died.“The safety and health of UN personnel, delegates and all others on the premises is the number one priority,” Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support Atul Khare said in a UN article.""The physical return of personnel to the workplace will be in accordance with and will follow - not get ahead of - the loosening of restrictions by New York City and State.”According to the Department of Operational Support, preparations are under way for an eventual return under Phase 1, with staff from the Facilities and Commercial Activities Service working round the clock to make offices and conference rooms in the 39-floor Secretariat ready.The United Nations Department of Global Communications (DGC) said in an article that during Phase 1, only select activities will be allowed in the UN headquarters.The department said that to move into Phase 1, the ‘New York on PAUSE’ executive order must be relaxed.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had extended New York's PAUSE order, which required people to stay-at-home and all non-essential businesses closed, till June 13.However, regions across the state have begun phased re-opening once they met seven health-related criteria mandated by the state.The UN said for the first phase of its re-opening, improvements must also be seen in the local epidemic situation and health care capability, in accordance with city and state recommendations.In the first phase, maximum occupancy at the Headquarters complex will be capped at 400 people a day, as opposed to the 4,200 limit in normal times. Emphasis will be strictly on those tasks that must be performed on site and many critical tasks will continue to be done remotely, the department said.While staff needed to perform on-site functions will be expected to arrive wearing face coverings, no temperature checks will be required to enter the premises and no testing for COVID-19 will be required before their return to the workplace.All persons on the premises will be expected to wear face coverings when in common areas such as lobbies, elevators, corridors and restrooms. In general, they will not be required to put on masks at their desks.During Phases 1 and 2, routine administrative or organisational face-to-face meetings will not be permitted.The department said that crews have been deployed to disinfect high-density and high-touch areas in the Headquarters complex, which comprises the 39-floor Secretariat tower, the General Assembly Hall, as well as conference and library buildings.Frequently used areas and surfaces – from lobbies, elevators and restrooms, to furniture, doorknobs, switch plates, as well as handrails, turnstiles and counters are being deep cleaned.Corridors and walls are being marked to designate new pedestrian traffic routes to ensure that if people are waiting in queues, they still meet physical distancing requirements. Hand-sanitising stations are being installed in lobbies and other common areas, including at least one station on each office floor.In Phase 2, building occupancy will gradually increase to a maximum 1,100 personnel a day at the Headquarters complex, or about 40 per cent of normal levels.Alternate working arrangements will largely remain in place and many personnel will continue to work remotely.Shifting from Phase 1 to 2 will require a further reduction in the epidemic and strengthening of the health care system in the host city, the UN said.The UN said phase 3 will be a ‘new normal’ and would take place when workplace risks are reduced to pre-epidemic levels, and COVID-19 related restrictions are lifted by New York City and State, including those that will allow for the reopening of day-care services and public schools.The Department of Operational Support says it was still too early to outline the work modalities that would be in place under the third phase.""COVID-19 has changed the way we live, work and interact,” Khare said.“But we are resilient, and together we can navigate through this, while maintaining physical distancing of course."

Bilateral trade between the two countries stood at $642.42 million in 2016-17.Cumulative investments from India into Kazakhstan and from Kazakhstan to India from 2005 to 2016 amounted to $244 million and $83.09 million respectively, according to figures provided by the Indian External Affairs Ministry. Sushma Swaraj also said that India has keen interest in improving connectivity with the Central Asian region. ""In December 2017, India acceded to TIR convention and in February 2018, India joined the Ashgabat Agreement,"" she said. ""The International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is gaining momentum and the member states are working together to popularise the corridor.""The Transports Internationaux Routiers (TIR) Convention is a multilateral treaty that seeks to simplify and harmonise the administrative formalities of international transport.The Ashgabat Agreement is a multimodal transport agreement between India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Oman, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Sushma Swaraj also said that she and Abdrakhmanov expressed their interest to further strengthen defence cooperation between the two sides ""based on solid foundation that we have in place"". ""Our defence and security sector cooperation has intensified in the last two years,"" she said. ""Kazakh Armed Forces Unit underwent training on peacekeeping operations in India and presently a mobile training team from the Indian Army is training Kazakh personnel in Almaty.""Pointing out that both countries have growing cooperation in capacity building, Sushma Swaraj said: ""Kazakhstan's professionals and students have been attending courses on scholarships in India every year under ICCR (Indian Council for Cultural Relations) and ITEC (Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation) programme in a wide range of disciplines."" She also stressed on enhancing people-to-people contact and promoting tourism between the two countries. Following the delegation-level talks, Sushma Swaraj called on Kazakh Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev. ""Good exchange of views on strengthening cooperation in trade and investment, ICT, joint film production, tourism and people-to-people contacts,"" Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar tweeted following the meeting.Sushma Swaraj arrived here on Thursday on the first leg of her three-nation Central Asian tour that will also see her visiting Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.She interacted with members of the around 7,000-strong Indian community in Kazakhstan soon after her arrival."
c7439860555a3544d0dc383a9fa0d515,"This screen grab from a Facebook group and photographed on a computer screen in Washington, Monday, April 9, 2018, shows what appears to be a bucket of tiger teeth offered for sale on a Facebook page.Facebook is displaying advertisements for well-known American corporations on group pages operated by overseas wildlife traffickers illegally selling the body parts of threatened animals, including elephant ivory, rhino horn and tiger teeth.In a secret complaint filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, wildlife preservation advocates allege that Facebook's failure to stop illicit traders using its service for illegal activity violates the social network's responsibilities as a publicly traded company. Facebook didn't respond to requests for comment. Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, was expected to testify on Capitol Hill on Tuesday about other issues.Related Stories Did Cambridge Analytica get your private FB data? You'll know soonMark Zuckerberg prepares another apology, this time to CongressThe complaint, a copy of which was provided to The Associated Press, was initially filed in August on behalf of an undercover informant represented by the National Whistleblower Center, a non-profit legal advocacy group. The identity of the informant, who recorded video of face-to-face meetings with wildlife traffickers set up over Facebook, has been kept confidential out of safety concerns.The SEC declined to comment on Monday on whether the whistleblower complaint triggered an investigation of the company.""Facebook is not an innocent bystander to these crimes,"" said Stephen Kohn, executive director of the National Whistleblower Center. ""Facebook sold advertisements on the very pages the illegal ivory was being marketed.""Facebook is one of 20 technology companies that last month joined the Global Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online, which was organised by Google and the World Wildlife Fund. Weeks after the March 7 announcement, an AP reporter was able to see scores of internationally banned wildlife products for sale in public and private Facebook groups, most based in Southeast Asia.Among the items available were belts made from what appeared to be the fur of Bengal tigers, a critically endangered species with only about 2,500 still living in the wild. Also advertised were horns from black rhinos, a species heavily targeted by poachers with little more than 5,000 still roaming Africa.Negotiations over price and delivery are often initiated by Facebook Messenger. Instagram and WhatsApp, two social media platforms also owned by Facebook, are also sometimes used by traffickers.The allegations tying Facebook to the illegal trafficking of wildlife are surfacing while the company is already scrambling to recover from a privacy scandal that has wiped out $79 billion in shareholder wealth during the past three weeks. The crisis stems from revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining firm connected to President Donald Trump's successful 2016 campaign, had exploited weaknesses in Facebook's privacy controls to collect personal information about 87 million people without their consent.Zuckerberg will try to reverse the backlash against the company when he opens two days of testimony in Congress. His appearance will give lawmakers the opportunity to grill him about the Cambridge Analytica episode, as well as evidence that Russian agents manipulated Facebook's network to spread false information that may have swayed the 2016 election.The SEC complaint may trigger other lines of inquiry about how much of Facebook's annual revenue of $41 billion has been generated by ads running on pages featuring illegal activity, such as the sale of elephant ivory and tiger teeth.Facebook hasn't disclosed that some of its revenue may be tied to illegal trafficking in wildlife in regulatory filings that are supposed to outline various risks and other threats that could crimp its profits or stock price.Trafficking investigators say they have seen no drop off in the illegal products offered for sale on Facebook after prior public pledges by the company to crack down. They are calling on federal security regulators to force Facebook to immediately freeze accounts being used by illegal traffickers and cooperate with international law enforcement to identify the individuals involved for prosecution.""The amount of ivory being traded on Facebook is horrifying,"" said Gretchen Peters, executive director of the Center on Illicit Networks and Transnational Organized Crime, which has analyzed online groups where wildlife goods are being marketed. ""I have looked at thousands of posts containing ivory, and I am convinced that Facebook is literally facilitating the extinction of the elephant species."""
ab2a00daf6a08120a2a4caba029a53b9,"A mink eats fish in meadow near the village of Khatenchitsy, 65 kilometers northwest of Minsk, Belarus.Mink have contracted coronavirus, adding to the list of animals known to be at risk of catching the virus. Mink at two fur farms in the Netherlands tested positive for COVID-19 a week ago, the BBC reported. And last month, it was revealed that lions and tigers at a New York zoo had caught the disease from their keepers.Coronavirus could be ""catastrophic"" for endangered wildlife and we must act now to protect them, said Dr Peta Hitchens of the University of Melbourne.This includes thorough regulation of wildlife trade and trafficking, as well as protection of ecosystems where human encroachment and destruction ""has resulted in increased interactions between us and wild animals"".It's not surprising that mink have been infected, she added. The list of mammal species infected during the 2003 Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak numbers at least 16, including mink, palm civets, fruit bats, several species of horseshoe bat, red fox, wild boar, raccoon dog, and domestic cats and dogs.Officials in The Netherlands believe mink contracted the illness from farm workers and the farms have since been put into quarantine.The creation of new mink farms was banned there in 2013, while existing mink fur farms have until 2024 to close.Animal rights organisation Peta has written a letter to ministers calling for the farms to be shut down immediately: ""Allowing mink farms to maintain business as usual for nearly four more years - in the face of a global crisis stemming from animal exploitation - would be inexcusable from the perspective of both the risk posed to humans and the harm inflicted on the mink themselves.""Animal protection charity Humane Society International, which campaigns for a global end to the fur trade, has warned of the risk in other countries, where tens of millions of mink, fox, raccoon dogs, chinchillas and rabbits are farmed.Claire Bass, executive director of Humane Society International/UK, said in addition to animal suffering, the potential for disease spread is another reason for all fashion companies to go fur-free and for governments to shut down ""this dirty trade"".""One of the lessons we must learn from COVID-19 is that we cannot carry on pushing animals to the limit of their endurance without serious consequences for both animal and human health,"" she said.""We urge the Netherlands and other countries in the process of phasing out fur farming to speed up their industry closures, and countries yet to commit to bans, including China and Finland, to do so now.""A spokesperson for the British Fur Trade Association said: ""The case in the Netherlands demonstrates the efficiency of fur farming bio security measures in Europe and the rigorous controls that are in place. The Dutch authorities confirm that there is no further spread of the virus and that the risk of onward transmission is negligible. ""According to a 2016 report released by the Chinese Academy of Engineering, 75% of China's wildlife trade is dominated by fur production with animals farmed for their fur, such as raccoon dogs, foxes and mink, often ending up at wildlife wet market."

6978fe317977c0a7df4038fb4fb75bcd,"British Home Secretary Amber Rudd today said that the bomber who carried out the suicide attack in Manchester city that killed 22 people may not have acted alone.     “It was a devastating occasion, it was more sophisticated than some of the attacks we’ve seen before, and it seems likely - possible - that he wasn’t doing this on his own,” Rudd said. Libyan-origin Salman Abedi blew himself up at end of an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena on Monday night, killing 22 people and injuring 64 others.      Following the attack, the UK’s terror threat level was raised to “critical”, indicating the security services believe more attacks may be imminent. According to Rudd, up to 3,800 troops will be deployed on the streets around Britain. Last night, after chairing a meeting of the emergency response committee COBRA, British Prime Minister Theresa May had said that soldiers would be placed in key public locations to support armed police in protecting the public.  These include Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, embassies and the Palace of Westminster.      Military personnel may also be seen at other events over the coming weeks, such as concerts and football matches, working under the command of police officers, May said.  Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, the UK’s most senior anti-terrorism officer with Scotland Yard, said: “We still have some critical lines of enquiry that we’re urgently chasing down. But that leaves a degree of uncertainty which has led the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre to independently judge that the threat level needs to be raised to critical, meaning a further attack may be imminent”.      “The public would expect the police at this moment to be doing extraordinary things, everything possible to protect them. The first thing we do is stretch our police resources.  We have mobilisation plans, we cancel leave, we stretch shifts. We can double the number of officers on the streets, both armed and unarmed,” Rowley said.     The first time the threat level was raised to critical in the UK was in 2006 during a major operation to stop a plot to blow up transatlantic airliners with liquid bombs.  Then in 2007, security chiefs raised it once more as they hunted for the men who had tried to bomb a London nightclub, before going on to attack Glasgow Airport.   The Islamic State (ISIS) terror network has claimed responsibility for Monday night’s attack by Abedi.(With PTI inputs)"

3371b4fefc0aea369760ae4868b04188,"Indian national pleads guilty to operating call centres to scam Americans (Representational image)An Indian national has pleaded guilty for his involvement in a multi-million dollar India-based call centre scam that targeted Americans, according to the Department of Justice. Hitesh Madhubhai Patel played a ""prominent"" role in operating and funding the call centres whose callers and US-based conspirators defrauded American victims between 2013 and 2016, it said on Thursday.Patel (43), also known as Hitesh Hinglaj, of Ahmedabad, pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and general conspiracy to commit identification fraud, access device fraud, money laundering, and impersonation of a federal officer or employee, the department said. He was prosecuted in the US after being extradited from Singapore in April 2019 to face charges in the telefraud and money laundering case.Singapore authorities apprehended Patel at the request of the US, pursuant to a provisional arrest warrant in September 2018, after he flew there from India. ""Hitesh Patel played a prominent role in this massive, India-based fraud scheme that bilked vulnerable Americans out of millions of dollars,"" Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski said""This important resolution would not have occurred without the assistance of our Singaporean colleagues, to whom we extend our deep appreciation,"" he said. In his guilty plea, Patel and his co-conspirators perpetrated a complex scheme in which employees from call centres in Ahmedabad, impersonated officials from the IRS and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, and engaged in other telephone call scams designed to defraud victims throughout the US.The Justice Department said US victims were threatened with arrest, imprisonment, fines or deportation if they did not pay alleged monies owed to the government. Those who fell victim to the scammers were instructed how to provide payment, including by purchasing general purpose reloadable (GPR) cards or wiring money, it said. Upon payment, the call centres would immediately turn to a network of “runners” based in the US to liquidate and launder the fraudulently obtained funds, the department added.In his plea, Patel admitted to operating and funding several India-based call centres from which the fraud schemes were perpetrated, including the call centre HGLOBAL, it said. Patel corresponded by email and WhatsApp messaging frequently with his co-defendants to exchange.He also received monthly income and expense reports to his personal email from the call centres, and used his Indian cell phone number to access GPR cards through automated telephone systems on many occasions.A co-defendant described Patel as “the top person in India and the boss for whom most of the other defendants worked,” and the owner of multiple call centres. He was arrested in India in 2016, but then later released, another co-defendant said. Patel admitted that a reasonably foreseeable loss of more than USD25 million but less than USD65 million was attributable to him, based on the government's evidence against him. ALSO READ | 65-year-old Mumbai man enrolls on dating site, loses ₹ 73.5 lakh to fake call centre "

In a statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs said that counter-terrorism investigations into the suspicious activities of 37 people in Singapore have been carried out after most of them posted on social media, inciting violence or stoking community unrest in the aftermath of the terror attacks in France.Of the 37 people, 14 are Singaporeans and 23 foreigners, mostly Bangladeshis, it said.""The 14 Singaporeans comprise 10 males and four females, and are aged between 19 and 62 years old.

He believed that he would be a martyr if he died while doing so,"" it said.In mid-2019, Faysal shifted his allegiance to Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), another militant group fighting to establish an Islamic caliphate in Syria.""He donated funds to a Syria-based organisation on the understanding that his donations would benefit the HTS' cause in Syria,"" the ministry said.""Faysal also actively shared propaganda promoting armed violence on social media accounts created under fictitious names."" Apart from ISIS and the HTS, Faysal also expressed support for other terrorist groups including Al-Qaeda and Al-Shabaab, the statement said.To prepare himself for an armed attack, Faysal watched firearms-related videos online. While Faysal is part of the 37, the ministry said he is not linked to the incidents in France.""While a handful of these individuals had commented on the same discussion threads on social media, the majority of the cases are not connected to each other,"" said the ministry.There is no indication that any of them were planning attacks or protests in Singapore, it added.The Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) have also enhanced their security measures and patrols.Attacks such as those in Saudi Arabia and Austria also signal a threat against French or Western interests, the ministry said. A ""palpable anti-France climate"" has developed in several countries, with large protests, calls for boycotts and an increase in terrorist rhetoric online.""In view of the deteriorating security situation, the Singapore Home Team has been on heightened security alert since early September and had also stepped up its security measures to pre-empt copycat attacks in Singapore,"" the ministry said.Speaking at the 16th Religious Rehabilitation Group Seminar held at Khadijah Mosque on Tuesday, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said the ""shape and nature"" of the terrorism threat has changed since last year.While the Islamic State has lost much of its physical territory in several countries and had key leaders killed, they are now a covert network, he noted.""Its propaganda on social media continues to radicalise and inspire attacks around the world, including here in Southeast Asia,"" the minister was quoted as saying by the channel.Counter-terrorism efforts in the region have reduced the number of attacks, but the terrorists are adapting, he said. Attacks in France and Austria also highlight that the threat of terrorism remains, he added.The ISD has ""ramped up"" counter-terrorism investigations into suspicious activity, individuals who are suspected of being radicalised as well as individuals whose conduct could ""threaten Singapore's communal harmony"", said the ministry.The Singaporeans and foreigners who have been investigated had “attracted security attention for suspected radical inclinations, or for making comments which incite violence, or stoked communal unrest"", it added."

The Zodiac terrorized Northern California communities and killed five people in the Bay Area in 1968 and 1969.According to code-breaking expert David Oranchak, the cipher’s text includes, “I hope you are having lots of fun in trying to catch me. ...

57d8a88d8bab86ac5cd11b4100ca6edb,"Terming his disqualification from the National Assembly and Prime Minister’s post as a “joke”, Nawaz Sharif on Thursday exuded confidence that he will return as Pakistan PM for the fourth time. A five-member Supreme Court bench last month disqualified Sharif for dishonesty and ruled that corruption cases be filed against him and his children over the Panama Papers scandal, forcing the prime minister to quit for the record third time.  Addressing a huge gathering in Gujarat on the third day of his journey from Islamabad to Lahore via the Grand Trunk (GT) Road to display his political might, Sharif said even the judges who disqualified him failed to point out a single example of corruption against him. “Should this even be called a disqualification? I will be made prime minister by the masses again tomorrow,” he told a cheering crowd. “They have only removed me on paper but they have not removed me from your hearts. Is this removing me at all?” Sharif asked. He asked people to stand by him to make sure that their vote is respected. “I cannot accept this joke. Can you accept this joke that you elect someone, then he is disgraced and ousted,” he said.  “May I ask why I was ousted? Did I commit any kind of corruption? I am innocent and did not commit any financial wrong. That has been said by the judges who disqualified me.  Then why I have been ousted,” the 67-year-old veteran politician said. Sharif said the people’s vote had been trampled upon as millions of people elected a leader and a couple of people or five judges disgraced and sent him home.  He said it was for the people of Gujranwala to “think that removal was just”. Sharif, who could not complete his term for a third time, also asked the gathering, “Should I sit back and accept the verdict or fight the injustice?”  The people responded in unison with a big ‘No’, prompting Sharif to ask them to stand by him. “If you do not want me to sit back then you would have to stand by me. Then stand by me to change the fate of this nation. Promise me that you would do what I tell you,” he said. Sharif said the time had come to change the country. “We would have to make sure that your vote is respected.  It is a question of respect for vote of 20 crore people. I would not allow anyone to trample your right to elect leaders of choice,” Sharif said. He also announced that he would announce his future plan of action and asked his supporters to wait for it.  Sharif stepped down after being disqualified by the Supreme Court on July 28 and after staying in Murree and Islamabad, embarked on road journey to his home in Lahore in the company of thousands of his supporters.  He was greeted by supporters lining up on the both sides of road as he came out of the Punjab House in Islamabad on Wednesday, making it impossible for his motorcade to move. He covered about 30 km in 12 hours to reach Rawalpindi where he addressed a big rally. Yesterday, he resumed his travel from Rawalpindi and reached Jhelum in the evening and addressed an even bigger rally there. Later, he rested at a scenic hotel on the banks of the River Jhelum. He left Jhelum at around 12 PM and stopped in Gujarat for Friday prayers and addressed his supporters.  He has left for Gujranwala and will cross small towns of Wairabad, Gakhar Mandi etc. He is expected to halt briefly at some places to address his supporters. According to the scheduled of Pakistan Muslim League- Nawaz (PML-N), Sharif is expected to spend the night in Gujranwala. He would leave for Lahore in the morning and is expected to reach there at 4 PM today."
0d6ee53ac23831400b434dfafc46626f,"Ambulance staff take a man from outside a mosque in central Christchurch, New ZealandAt least 49 people were killed in mass shootings at two mosques full of worshippers attending Friday prayers on what the prime minister called “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.”One man was arrested and charged with murder in what appeared to be a carefully planned racist attack. Police also defused explosive devices in a car.Two other people were being held in custody. Police said they were trying to determine how they might be involved.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the events in Christchurch represented “an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence,” and that many of the victims could be migrants or refugees. In addition to the dead, she said more than 20 people were seriously wounded.“It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack,” Ardern said.Police took three men and a woman into custody after the shootings, which shocked people across the nation of 5 million people. One person was later released.While there was no reason to believe there were any more suspects, Ardern said the national security threat level was being raised from low to high, the second-highest level.National carrier Air New Zealand canceled at least 17 flights in and out of Christchurch, saying it couldn’t properly screen customers and their baggage following the shootings.Police said the investigation has extended 360 kilometers (240 miles) to the south, where homes in Dunedin were evacuated around a “location of interest.” A police statement gave no further detail of how it might be linked to the attacks.Authorities have not specified who they detained, but said none had been on any watch list. A man who claimed responsibility for the shootings left a 74-page anti-immigrant manifesto in which he explained who he was and his reasoning for the attack. He said he was a 28-year-old white Australian and a racist.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed that one of the people detained was an Australian-born citizen.Police Commissioner Mike Bush said Friday night that a man had been charged with murder. He did not say whether police believed the same shooter was responsible for both attacks.Ardern alluded at a news conference to anti-immigrant sentiment as the possible motive, saying that while many people affected by the shootings may be migrants or refugees, “they have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home. They are us.”As for the suspects, Ardern said, “these are people who I would describe as having extremist views that have absolutely no place in New Zealand.”Bush said police had found two improvised explosive devices in one car, a clarification from an earlier statement that there were devices in multiple vehicles. He said they had disabled one and were in the process of disabling the second.The deadliest attack occurred at the Masjid Al Noor mosque in central Christchurch at about 1:45 p.m., when 41 people were killed.Witness Len Peneha said he saw a man dressed in black enter the mosque and then heard dozens of shots, followed by people running from the mosque in terror.Peneha, who lives next door to the mosque, said the gunman ran out of the mosque, dropped what appeared to be a semi-automatic weapon in his driveway, and fled. He said he then went into the mosque to try to help.“I saw dead people everywhere. There were three in the hallway, at the door leading into the mosque, and people inside the mosque,” he said. “I don’t understand how anyone could do this to these people, to anyone. It’s ridiculous.”He said he helped about five people recover in his home. He said one was slightly injured.“I’ve lived next door to this mosque for about five years and the people are great, they’re very friendly,” he said. “I just don’t understand it.”He said the gunman was white and was wearing a helmet with some kind of device on top, giving him a military-type appearance.A video that was apparently livestreamed by the shooter shows the attack in horrifying detail. The gunman spends more than two minutes inside the mosque spraying terrified worshippers with bullets again and again, sometimes re-firing at people he has already cut down.He then walks outside to the street, where he shoots at people on the sidewalk. Children’s screams can be heard in the distance as he returns to his car to get another rifle.The gunman then walks back into the mosque, where there are at least two dozen people lying on the ground. After walking back outside and shooting a woman there, he gets back in his car, where the song “Fire” by English rock band “The Crazy World of Arthur Brown” can be heard blasting from the speakers. The singer bellows, “I am the god of hellfire!” and the gunman drives away. The video then cuts out.During a second shooting at the Linwood Masjid Mosque, seven people were killed.One more person died later at Christchurch Hospital.Mark Nichols told the New Zealand Herald he heard about five gunshots and that a Friday prayer-goer returned fire with a rifle or shotgun.Nichols said he saw two injured people being carried out on stretchers past his automotive shop and that both people appeared to be alive.The police commissioner warned anybody who was thinking of going to a mosque anywhere in New Zealand on Friday to stay put.The man who claimed responsibility for the shooting said he came to New Zealand only to plan and train for the attack. He said he was not a member of any organization, but had donated to and interacted with many nationalist groups, though he acted alone and no group ordered the attack.He said the mosques in Christchurch and Linwood would be the targets, as would a third mosque in the town of Ashburton if he could make it there.He said he chose New Zealand because of its location, to show that even the most remote parts of the world were not free of “mass immigration.”New Zealand is generally considered to be a welcoming country for migrants and refugees. Last year, the prime minister announced the country would boost its annual refugee quota from 1,000 to 1,500 starting in 2020. Ardern, whose party campaigned on the promise of raising the intake of refugees, called the planned increase “the right thing to do.”Home to nearly 400,000 people, Christchurch is the largest city on New Zealand’s South Island. Sometimes called the garden city, it has been rebuilding since an earthquake in 2011 killed 185 people and destroyed many downtown buildings.A cricket match between New Zealand and Bangladesh scheduled to start Saturday was canceled after the Bangladesh cricket team had a narrow escape.Players and members of the team’s coaching staff were reportedly on their bus, approaching the Masjid Al Noor mosque in Hagley Park when the shooting broke out.Batsman Tamim Iqbal tweeted “entire team got saved from active shooters. Frightening experience and please keep us in your prayers.”Mass shootings in New Zealand are rare. Before Friday’s attack, the deadliest shooting in modern history occurred in the small town of Aramoana in 1990, when gunman David Gray shot and killed 13 people following a dispute with a neighbor."

Laura began flinging rain across Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on Saturday morning and was expected to drench the Dominican Republic, Haiti and parts of Cuba during the day on its westward course. (AP Photo/Carlos Giusti)Two tropical storms advanced across the Caribbean on Saturday night as potentially historic threats to the U.S. Gulf Coast, one dumping rain on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands while the other was pushing through the gap between Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba.Tropical Storms Laura and Marco were both projected to approach Louisiana at or close to hurricane force just two days apart next week. A hurricane watch was issued for the New Orleans metro area, which was pummeled by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.Two hurricanes have never appeared in the Gulf of Mexico at the same time, according to records going back to at least 1900, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. The last time two tropical storms were in the Gulf together was in 1959, he said.The last time two storms made landfall in the United States within 24 hours of each other was in 1933, Klotzbach said.The projected tracks from the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Saturday afternoon pointed to both storms being together in the Gulf on Monday, with Marco hitting Louisiana and Laura making landfall in the same general area Wednesday. But large uncertainties remain for that time span, and forecasts have varied greatly so far for the two storms.“We are in unprecedented times,” Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said at a news conference Saturday as he declared a state of emergency. “We are dealing with not only two potential storms in the next few hours, we are also dealing with COVID-19.”He urged residents to prepare for the storms and, if possible, find places to evacuate that are not public shelters.A hurricane watch was issued for Intracoastal City, Louisiana, eastward to the Mississippi-Alabama border.People in Louisiana headed to stores to stock up on food, water and other supplies. Raymond Monday of Gretna, though, had only a generator on his cart at Sam’s Club. “We’ve got a freezer full of food” at home, along with large containers of water, he said.Laura flung rain across Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on Saturday and was expected to drench the Dominican Republic, Haiti and parts of Cuba through Sunday on its westward course.Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez declared a state of emergency and warned that flooding could be worse than what Tropical Storm Isaias unleashed three weeks ago because the ground is now saturated. The storm knocked down trees in the island’s southern region, and left more than 200,000 clients without power and more than 10,000 without water across the U.S. territory.“No one should be out on the streets,” she said.Officials said they were most concerned about the thousands of people in Puerto Rico who still have been living under blue tarps since 2017′s Hurricane Maria and the hundreds of families living along the island’s southern coast in homes damaged by a string of strong earthquakes this year.The storm was centered about 85 miles (135) kilometers east-southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, on Saturday night, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). It was moving west at 18 mph (30 kph).As the storm approached Hispaniola, crews in the Dominican Republic began evacuating dozens of families in flood-prone areas.Marco, meanwhile, was strengthening while centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) west-northwest of Cuba’s western tip, headed to the north-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph). It had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph) and was expected to become a hurricane later Saturday.Carlos Joaquín González, governor of Mexico’s Quintana Roo state, celebrated that Marco’s changed trajectory spared his state’s beaches, including those in Cancun, the country’s top tourist destination.The National Hurricane Center said it expected the storms to stay far enough apart to prevent direct interaction as the region braces for the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which is forecast to be unusually active.Both storms were expected to bring 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain to areas they were passing over or near, threatening widespread flooding across a vast region.“A lot of people are going to be impacted by rainfall and storm surge in the Gulf of Mexico,” said Joel Cline, the tropical program coordinator for the National Weather Service. “Since you simply don’t know, you really need to make precautions.”ADVERTISEMENT It seems fitting for such an unusual twin threat to arrive in 2020, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.“Of course, we have to have two simultaneously land-falling hurricanes,” McNoldy said. “It’s best not to ask what’s next.” )Forecasters said that while atmospheric conditions were favorable for Laura to grow, its passage over Puerto Rico and the mountains of Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Cuba could tear it apart or weaken it before it entered warm Gulf waters conducive to growth.Officials in the Florida Keys, which Laura might pass over on its route into the Gulf, declared a local state of emergency Friday and issued a mandatory evacuation order for anyone living on boats, in mobile homes and in campers. Tourists staying in hotels should be aware of hazardous weather conditions and consider altering their plans starting on Sunday, Monroe County officials said in a news release.Citing both storm systems, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Friday night. “It is too soon to know exactly where, when or how these dual storms will affect Louisiana, but now is the time for our people to prepare for these storms,” Edwards said in a statement.Laura had earlier forced the closure of schools and government offices in the eastern Caribbean islands of Anguilla and Antigua, according to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency."
cb1481e53ce8110b3723fd79f59928ad,"A Palestinian attacker opened fire early on Tuesday at the entrance to a settlement outside Jerusalem, killing three Israeli security men and critically wounding a fourth, Israeli police and medical services said, in one of the deadliest attacks in a two-year spate of violence.Israeli officials said the attacker was a 37-year-old Palestinian father of four, with a valid work permit in Israel and a troubled personal life who appeared to have acted alone.The attack comes at a tense period amid the Jewish high holidays and is likely to complicate the mediation efforts of U.S. peace envoy Jason Greenblatt who just arrived in the region for meetings with Israeli and Palestinians leaders.Speaking at his weekly Cabinet meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack was partially a result of systematic Palestinian incitement and said he expected Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to “condemn this attack and not try to justify it.”Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said the attacker approached the back gate entrance of the Har Adar settlement, hiding among dozens of Palestinian day laborers who were being checked by security forces.The man aroused police suspicions and was asked to stop, Samri said. At that point, he pulled out a weapon and began opening fire at the forces from close range. The attacker was then shot dead by other forces at the scene.The casualties were identified as Solomon Gavria, a 20-year-old policeman, and two private security guards — Yousef Othman and Or Arish, who were both 25 years old. The Magen David Adom medical service said that in addition to the three killed, a fourth Israeli man, aged 32, was evacuated to hospital in critical condition.Har Adar is an upscale community west of Jerusalem, straddling the seam line between the West Bank and Israel proper and known for its good relations with its Arab neighbors — an unusual target in the wave of violence that Israel has been coping with over the past two years.Shay Retter, the head of Har Adar’s security committee, said between 100 and 150 Palestinian laborers typically enter the community every day for work. Local residents said they knew the attacker from previous work he had carried out in the community and were shocked to hear what he had done. The military imposed a closure on the nearby Palestinian village of Beit Surik, the home of the attacker.Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said he saw no difference between Palestinian terrorism and radical Islamic terrorism targeting sites in Europe and elsewhere.“Before talking about any kind of negotiations, the world must demand of the Palestinian Authority to stop its incitement and encouragement of terror,” he said, alluding to Greenblatt’s visit and his goal of securing concessions for Palestinians.Minister of Intelligence Israel Katz was even blunter.“The attack is also a message to special U.S. envoy Greenblatt,” he said. “Israel’s security was and yet remains the supreme consideration in the government’s policy, and is above any other consideration of improving and easing the lives of the Palestinians.”Netanyahu pledged that as a punitive measure, the attacker’s home would be demolished and working permits of his extended family would be revoked.However, Israel’s internal Shin Bet security service downplayed ideology as a motive, saying the attacker was plagued with personal issues.The attacker was identified as Nimr Mahmoud Ahmed Jamal and the Shin Bet said its preliminary investigation indicated there was significant violence in his family. His wife had recently fled to Jordan to escape his abuse and left him with their four children, it said.In a message to his estranged wife that he asked her to share on Facebook, Jamal praised her and called himself a bad husband.“I was very jealous and I’ve done terrible things in the community,” he wrote. “I ask you to forgive me and take care of the kids.”Since September 2015, Palestinians have killed 51 Israelis, two visiting Americans and a British tourist in stabbings, shooting and car-ramming attacks. Several of these attacks were carried out by individuals struggling with domestic and emotional issues whose acts were subsequently cloaked in nationalism.During that same time, Israeli forces have killed over 255 Palestinians. Israel says most of them were attackers and others died in clashes with Israeli forces. Most of the attacks have been stabbings against security forces, primarily in the West Bank.Israel blames the violence on incitement by Palestinian religious and political leaders compounded on social media sites that glorify violence and encourage attacks. Palestinians say the attacks stem from anger and frustration at decades of Israeli rule in territories they claim for a state.The frequency and intensity of attacks has lessened of late but such an incident, coming amid the Jewish high holiday, threatened to ignite them anew.Gaza’s Islamic Hamas rulers praised the attack but stopped short of taking responsibility for it. In a statement, the group called the assault a “heroic operation” that was a “natural response” to Israeli aggression against Palestinians and proved that the Palestinian uprising was still alive.Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said “the cruel terror attack proves once again the daily front that our security forces face in the most important mission — protecting and defending the safety of the citizens of Israel.”"
ecb81f97ae59e4ee5b3f456b5df4cc3e,"Situation on boil post Myanmar coup, water cannon fired at protesters as crowds swellTension in the confrontations between the authorities and demonstrators against last week’s coup in Myanmar boiled over Monday, as police fired a water cannon at peaceful protesters in the capital Naypyitaw.On Sunday, in the town of Myawaddy on Myanmar’s eastern border with Thailand, police shot into the air in an evident effort to disperse a rowdy crowd. There had been no initial reports of injuries, but the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an independent watchdog group, said one woman had been shot, without providing further details.There have been no signs that either protesters or the military was backing down in their confrontation over who is the country’s legitimate government: Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party, which won a landslide victory in last November’s election, or the junta that formed one week ago and which claims the polls were marred by voting fraud.Nonviolent protests demanding the release of the detained Suu Kyi and restoration of her government have spread all over the country, with awareness of them growing after the authorities on Sunday lifted a brief ban on internet access.State media appears to have ignored the protests, but videos and reports on the demonstrations were being posted by social media users.There were reports of new protests Monday in Kachin State in the north, Mon State in the southeast, Tachileik, a border town in eastern Shan State, Naypyitaw and Mandalay, the country’s second largest city, where there were both marchers and a procession of motorbikes.READ MORE: Myanmar blocks access to Twitter, InstagramThe protests in Naypyitaw, ongoing for several days, have been especially unusual, for a great part of the city’s population are civil servants and their families. The city was purpose-built under a previous military government, has a heavy military presence and lacks the tradition of protest of the former capital, Yangon.A morning protest in Yangon, Myanmar’s biggest city, swelled rapidly with the crowd exceeding a thousand demonstrators at a major downtown intersection.Image Source : APSituation on boil post Myanmar coup, water cannon fired at protesters as crowds swellSituation on boil post Myanmar coup, water cannon fired at protesters as crowds swellThey chanted slogans, raised a three-finger salute and carried placards saying “Reject the military coup” and “Justice for Myanmar.” Some smaller groups broke off from the main protest and headed to the Sule Pagoda, a past rallying point for major protests against previous ruling juntas.On Sunday, the golden-domed pagoda served as a rallying point for tens of thousands of demonstrators, as it did protesters against military rule during a massive 1988 uprising and again during a 2007 revolt led by Buddhist monks.The military used deadly force to end both of those uprisings, with estimates of hundreds if not thousands killed in 1988. While riot police have watched the protests this past week, soldiers have been absent and there have been no reports of major clashes.The growing protests are a sharp reminder of the long and bloody struggle for democracy in a country that the military ruled directly for more than five decades before loosening its grip in 2012. Suu Kyi’s government, which also won a landslide election in 2015, was the first led by civilians in decades, though its power was limited by a military-drafted constitution.A call for a general strike was issued late Sunday by several activist groups in Yangon, but it was not clear if it had been widely circulated or adopted by the informally organized civil disobedience movement at the forefront of the protests.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners in Myanmar, an independent watchdog group, says 165 people, mostly politicians, had been detained since the Feb. 1 coup, with just 13 released.One foreigner has been confirmed held by the authorities, Sean Turnell, an economist at Australia’s Macquarie University who was an adviser to Suu Kyi’s government. He was detained Saturday under unclear circumstances.A statement issued Monday by the office of Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said he was being provided with consular support and described him as ” a highly regarded advisor, member of the academic community.”″“We certainly believe he should be immediately released,” it said.The military has accused Suu Kyi’s government of failing to act on its complaints that last November’s election was marred by fraud, though the election commission said it had found no evidence to support the claims.The elected lawmakers of Suu Kyi’s party have asked for international recognition as the country’s government after meeting online Friday to declare themselves as the sole legitimate representatives of the people. The military barred them from convening Parliament last week.READ MORE: Burmese military should relinquish power: Joe Biden on Myanmar coup"
b54c30a53cc90c2533d73d3729235db8,"Citing the ""dramatic floods"" in India and Nepal, UN chief Antonio Guterres has urged nations to commit to the historic Paris deal to address the threats posed by climate change as natural disasters become frequent and more devastating.Weeks of torrential monsoon rains and catastrophic flooding in India, Nepal and Bangladesh have devastated the lives of millions of children and families. UNICEF estimates that almost 16 million children and their families are in urgent need of life-saving support. Since mid-August, there have been at least 1,288 reported deaths.""First of all, climate change today is undeniable. In the US, as in Portugal and other parts of the world, we are seeing heat waves, we are seeing dramatic floods – Sierra Leone, India, Nepal – we always had floods in the past but now natural disasters are becoming more frequent, more intense and with more devastating consequences,"" Guterres said.He said as deserts are progressing, glaciers diminishing and sea levels starting to rise, it is clearly a threat to humanity. ""To fight it we have today an important instrument – the Paris Agreement. We need to make sure that all countries commit themselves to that [accord],"" he said.Without naming the US, which has decided to pull out of the climate accord, Guterres said wherever countries are not able to commit to the climate deal at the government level, societies, the business communities and cities should lead the process.The Paris climate deal aims to prevent the Earth from heating up by 2 degrees Celsius since the start of the industrial age. The US is the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China.""…In this way, we can be able to meet the Paris Agreement, but with an increased ambition because Paris is not enough to be able to contain global warming at the level that is acceptable,"" he added.With the world facing the challenges of terrorism, extremism and the refugee crisis, Guterres said the UN must be an instrument for a surge in diplomacy for peace. He said nations must forget their and come together to put an end to these tragic series of crises, violence and conflicts.""Because these conflicts are also becoming more and more interlinked and more linked to global terrorism. So we need to fight terrorists where they are, but we need to address the root causes of terrorism,"" he said.Guterres asserted that there is need for nations to come together to solve conflicts and at the same time build cohesive societies where ""people can feel they belong, where they don't feel discriminated [against] and respect human rights, to make sure that terrorist organisations have more and more difficulties recruiting people"".""So we need – in sustainable development, in human rights and in a peace and security approach – to combine all the UN instruments in order to be able to defeat terrorism,"" he added.Earlier this week, Guterres had said that India, China and the US have experienced the most natural disasters since 1995 as he urged nations to get serious about keeping the ambition high on climate action.""The United States, followed by China and India, have experienced the most disasters since 1995,"" Guterres had said, adding that last year alone, 24.2 million people were displaced by sudden-onset disasters – three times as many as by conflict and violence.Guterres had said the UN stands ready to support relief efforts in any way possible. He added that the number of natural disasters has nearly quadrupled since 1970."

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)Three massive wildfires chewed through parched Northern California landscape Sunday as firefighters raced to dig breaks and make other preparations ahead of a frightening weather system. That system was packing high winds and more of the lightning that sparked the huge blazes and scores of other fires around the state, putting nearly a quarter-million people under evacuation orders and warnings.At the CZU Lightning Complex fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains. south of San Francisco, authorities said their effort was hindered by people who refused to heed evacuation orders and those who were using the chaos to steal. Santa Cruz County Sheriff Jim Hart said 100 officers were patrolling and anyone not authorized to be in an evacuation zone would be arrested.“What we’re hearing from the community is that there’s a lot of looting going on,” Hart said. He said eight people have been arrested or cited and “there’s going to be more.”He and county District Attorney Jeff Rosell expressed anger at what Rosell called the “absolutely soulless” people who seek to victimize those already victimized by the fire. Among the victims was a fire commander who was robbed while helping coordinate efforts on Saturday.Someone entered the commander’s fire vehicle and stole personal items, including a wallet and “drained his bank account,” said Chief Mark Brunton, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).“I can’t imagine a bigger low-life,” Hart said, promising to catch him and vowing “the DA is going to hammer him.”The Santa Cruz fire is one of the “complexes,” or groups of fires, burning on all sides of the San Francisco Bay Area. They were started by lightning strikes that were among 12,000 registered in the state in the past week.The National Weather Service issued a “red flag” warning through Monday afternoon for the drought-stricken area, meaning extreme fire conditions including high temperatures, low humidity and wind gusts up to 65 mph (105 kph) that “may result in dangerous and unpredictable fire behavior.”In nearly a week, firefighters have gotten no more than the 17% containment for the LNU Lightning Complex fire in wine country north of San Francisco. It’s been the most destructive blaze, accounting for five deaths and 845 destroyed homes and other buildings. It and a fire burning southeast of the Bay Area are among the five largest fires in state history, with both burning more than 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers).In Southern California, an 11-day-old blaze held steady at just under 50 square miles (106 square kilometers) near Lake Hughes in northern Los Angeles County mountains. Rough terrain, hot weather and the potential for thunderstorms with lightning strikes challenged firefighters.Holly Hansen, an evacuee from the LNU fire, was among evacuees from the community of Angwin being allowed to back their homes for one hour to retrieve belongings. She and her three dogs waited five hours in her SUV for their turn.“It’s horrible, I lived in Sonoma during the (2017) Tubbs Fire, so this is time No. 2 for me. It’s horrible when you have to think about what to take,” she said. “I think it’s a very raw human base emotion to have fear of fire and losing everything. It’s frightening.”Meantime, firefighters were frantically preparing for thunderstorms that will bring high winds and “dry” lightning, a term used when such storms have little or no rain. Brunton said while he’s confident firefighters did the most with the time they had to prepare, he’s not sure what to expect.“There’s a lot of potential for things to really go crazy out there,” he said.Since Aug. 15, more than 500 fires of varying sizes have burned throughout California, scorching 1.2 million acres, or 1,875 square miles (4,856 square kilometers). Of those, about two dozen major fires were attracting much of the state’s resources.Most of the damage was caused by the three complex fires. They have burned 1,175 square miles (3.043 square kilometers), destroyed almost 1,000 homes and other structures and killed five people, three of whom who were found in a home in an area under an evacuation order.Other casualties included ancient redwood trees at California’s oldest state park, Big Basin Redwoods, plus the park’s headquarters and campgrounds. Smoke from the fires made the region’s air quality dangerous, forcing millions to stay inside.Officials surveying maps at command centers are astonished by the sheer size of the fires, Cal Fire spokesman Brice Bennett said.“You could overlay half of one of these fires and it covers the entire city of San Francisco,” Bennett said Sunday.Responding to the emergency, President Donald Trump on Saturday issued a major disaster declaration to provide federal assistance. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that the declaration will also help people in counties affected by the fires with crisis counseling, housing and other social services.Fire officials, meanwhile, have struggled to get enough resources to fight the biggest fires because so many blazes are burning around the state.The wine country fire has only 1,700 firefighters on scene. By comparison, the state had 5,000 firefighters assigned to the Mendocino Complex Fire in 2018, the largest fire in state history.“All of our resources remain stretched to capacity that we have not seen in recent history,” said Shana Jones, the chief for Cal Fire’s Sonoma-Lake-Napa unit."

I never encountered a situation where I was refused a service or entry into an establishment for wearing a turban,” Grewal, a graduate from the Stony Brook University, said. He said that he explained to the manager that he wore the turban to practice his religion and want to spend time with friends for the night, the New York Post reported.However, the manager at the Harbor Grill did not allow him inside, citing a new policy introduced at the bar that enforces a dress code after 10 pm on Friday and Saturday nights, restricting all head wear, the report said. “[He was] wearing what would be more widely perceived as the slang term ‘dew rag’ or a ‘stocking cap’ and not a traditional turban,” the restaurant wrote in a Facebook post after residents expressed outrage.“We do not allow hats or head wear in order to more capably identify people inside the establishment,” the restaurant said.Clarifying their stand, the restaurant said that Harbor Grill “embraces people of all races and religions,” and does not discriminate against anyone for their creed or colour.“We sincerely apologize for any distress that this incident may have caused. Please know that our weekend dress code policy is in place for the safety of all of our patrons,” the restaurant said. “Anyone wearing any type of hat is welcome during normal restaurant hours,” it said.Grewal said that Port Jefferson Mayor Margot Garant apologized to him for the incident and advised him on actions to take on the issue. He tried to obtain a police report today at a Suffolk County precinct but was told that “it was a civil matter, not a criminal matter,” the report said.“The officer recommended I contact a civil attorney or the ACLU. I plan to reach out to them today or tomorrow,” he said.“Throughout my life, I've faced verbal abuse and bullying about my appearance, mostly throughout school. However, my basic freedom of entering public accommodations was never infringed upon,” he said."

9acfee7b317c3828990cd695a9e0657b,"In this March 3, 2021, file photo, Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is held by pharmacist Madeline Acquilano at Hartford Hospital in HartfordHalf of all adults in the US have received at least one Covid-19 shot, the government announced Sunday, marking another milestone in the nation’s largest-ever vaccination campaign but leaving more work to do to convince skeptical Americans to roll up their sleeves. Almost 130 million people 18 or older have received at least one dose of a vaccine, or 50.4 per cent of the total adult population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Almost 84 million adults, or about 32.5 per cent of the population, have been fully vaccinated.The US cleared the 50 per cent mark just a day after the reported global death toll from the coronavirus topped a staggering 3 million, according to totals compiled by Johns Hopkins University, though the actual number is believed to be significantly higher. The country’s vaccination rate, at 61.6 doses administered per 100 people, currently falls behind Israel, which leads among countries with at least 5 million people with a rate of 119.2. The U.S. also trails the United Arab Emirates, Chile and the United Kingdom, which is vaccinating at a rate of 62 doses per 100 people, according to Our World in Data, an online research site.The vaccine campaign offered hope in places like Nashville, Tennessee, where the Music City Center bustled Sunday with vaccine seekers. High demand for appointment-only shots at the convention center has leveled off enough that walk-ins will be welcome starting this week.Amanda Grimsley, who received her second shot, said she’s ready to see her 96-year-old grandmother, who lives in Alabama and has been nervous about getting the vaccine after having a bad reaction to a flu shot.“It’s a little emotional. I haven’t been able to see my grandmother in a year and a half almost,” said Grimsley, 35. “And that’s the longest my entire family has ever gone without seeing her. And we’ll be seeing her in mid-May now.”The states with the highest vaccination rates have a history of voting Democratic and supporting President Joe Biden in the 2020 election: New Hampshire at the top, with 71.1%, followed by New Mexico, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine, CDC data show.The demand has not been the same in many areas of Tennessee — particularly, rural ones.Tennessee sits in the bottom four states for rates of adults getting at least one shot, at 40.8 per cent. It’s trailed only by Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi — three other Southern states that lean Republican and voted for Donald Trump last fall.Vaccination rates do not always align with how states vote. But polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has shown trends that link political leanings and attitudes about the vaccines and other issues related to the pandemic, which has killed more than 566,000 people in the U.S.A poll conducted in late March found that 36% of Republicans said they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated, compared with 12 per cent of Democrats. Similarly, a third of rural Americans said they were leaning against getting shots, while fewer than a fourth of people living in cities and suburbs shared that hesitancy.Overall, willingness to get vaccinated has risen, polling shows.In January, 67 per cent of adult Americans were willing to get vaccinated or had already received at least one shot. The figure has climbed to 75 per cent, according to the latest AP-NORC poll.Nationwide, 24 per cent of Black Americans and 22% per cent of Hispanic Americans say they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated, down from 41 per cent and 34 per cent in January, respectively. Among white Americans, 26 per cent now say they will not get vaccinated. In January, that number was 31 per cent.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said the goal is to get community figures, from athletes to clergy, to encourage vaccinations, particularly as the seven-day national average of cases remains over 60,000 new infections per day.“What we are doing is we’re trying to get, by a community core, trusted messages that anyone would feel comfortable with listening to, whether you’re a Republican, a Democrat, an independent or whomever you are, that you’re comfortable,” Fauci said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”Fauci also indicated Sunday that the government will likely move to resume use of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine this week, possibly with restrictions or broader warnings after reports of some very rare blood clot cases.In a series of news show interviews, Fauci said he expects a decision when advisers to the CDC meet Friday to discuss the pause in J&J’s single-dose vaccine.“I would be very surprised if we don’t have a resumption in some form by Friday,” he said. “I don’t really anticipate that they’re going to want it stretch it out a bit longer.”Fauci, who is President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said he believed federal regulators could bring the shots back with limits based on age or gender, or with a blanket warning, so the vaccine is administered in a way “a little bit different than we were before the pause.”The J&J vaccine was thrown into limbo after the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration said last week that they needed more evidence to decide if a handful of unusual blood clots were linked to the shot — and if so, how big the risk is.The reports are rare — six cases out of more than 7 million U.S. inoculations with the J&J vaccine. The clots were found in women between the ages of 18 and 48. One person died. Authorities stressed that they have found no sign of clot problems with the most widely used Covid-19 vaccines in the US — from Moderna and Pfizer."

The entire terminal was eventually closed. Images posted on social media showed a heavy police presence in the area and passengers were worried about missing flights. The Florida Highway Patrol tweeted earlier that all roads to the airport were shut down, with ""zero exceptions."" Orlando police later tweeted that entrances were open but congested. "

Even the Olympics, five months away, wasn’t far enough off to keep people from wondering if it would go on as planned.“We don’t expect a miracle in the short term,” said Kianoush Jahanpour of the health ministry in Iran, where an official tally of infections of 139 was doubted by some who thought the problem was far bigger.The World Health Organization, meanwhile, reported that the number of new cases outside China on Tuesday exceeded the number of new infections inside the country for the first time. The number in China was 412, while the tally in the rest of the world was 459. “The sudden increases of cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.About 81,000 people around the globe have been sickened by the coronavirus that kept finding new targets. With Brazil confirming the arrival of Latin America’s first case, the virus had a toehold on every continent but Antarctica.In Europe, where Germany, France and Spain were among the places with a growing caseload, an expanding cluster of more than 440 cases in northern Italy was eyed as a source for transmissions. In the Middle East, where cases increased in Bahrain, Kuwait and Iraq, blame was directed toward Iran. In Asia, where the crisis originated late last year in China, threats continued to emerge around the region, with South Korea battling a mass outbreak centered in the 2.5 million-person city of Daegu. And in the United States, which has 60 cases, President Donald Trump declared that the U.S. was “very, very ready” for whatever threat the coronavirus brings, and he put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of overseeing the country’s response.The illness had now spread to at least 39 countries, said world health officials, who simultaneously cautioned against the risks of unnecessary fears or stigma.“We are in a fight that can be won if we do the right things,” WHO chief Ghebreyesus said.Though the virus pushed into countries both rich and poor, its arrival in places with little ability to detect, respond and contain it brought concern it could run rampant there and spread easily elsewhere.“We’re going to be trying to slow down the spread so that our hospitals are not overwhelmed in one big gulp, one big hit,” said Ian Mackay, who studies viruses at the University of Queensland in Australia.Saudi Arabia announced a series of precautionary measures, including temporarily stopping tourists from places with confirmed outbreaks from entering the country, as well as pilgrims coming for the Umrah or to visit the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina.In South Korea, workers sanitized public buses, while in China, banks disinfected banknotes using ultraviolet rays. In Germany, authorities stressed “sneezing etiquette,” while in the United States, doctors announced a clinical trial of a possible coronavirus treatment.Around the world, as Christians marked the start of the holy season of Lent with Ash Wednesday, worshipers found churches closed and rituals changed by virus fears. Even in St. Peter’s Square, many of those gathered for Pope Francis’ weekly audience wore face masks and clergy appeared to refrain from embracing the pontiff or kissing his ring.Services in Singapore were broadcast online to keep people from crowded sanctuaries where germs could spread, bishops in South Korea shuttered churches for what they said was the first time in the Catholic Church’s 236-year history there, and in Malaysia and the Philippines, ashes were sprinkled on the heads of those marking the start of Lent instead of using a damp thumb to trace a cross of ashes.“We would like to be cautious so that the coronavirus will not spread,” said the Rev. Victorino Cueto, rector of the National Shrine of our Mother of Perpetual Help in Manila in the Philippines.Major gatherings were eyed warily, with organizers scrambling to respond in the face of the epidemic. Looming largest of all are the Olympic Games, whose opening ceremonies are scheduled for July 24 in Tokyo. A member of the International Olympic Committee, Richard Pound, sounded alarms a day earlier, saying the virus could force a cancellation of the games. The Japanese government, in turn, gave mixed signals, insisting they would go forward yet urging that sports events be curtailed for now.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for major sports and cultural events in the coming two weeks to be canceled or postponed to stem further infections. Meanwhile, the top government spokesman said Olympics preparations would proceed and the games would go on as planned.Among the other crowded places that had officials worried: Military bases.The South Korean military announced additional infections among its troops, with 20 cases on its bases and some 9,570 people in isolation. The U.S. military, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, confirmed the first infection of an American soldier, a 23-year-old man based at Camp Carroll near Daegu, a day after the Americans said a military spouse also had contracted the illness. Bowling alleys, movie theaters and a golf course on four American bases in the country were closed.“This is a setback, it’s true, there’s no getting around that. But it’s not the end of the war,” Col. Edward Ballanco, commander of the U.S. Army Garrison Daegu told troops in a video message. “We are very well equipped to fight this thing off.”Italy recorded 78 new infections on Wednesday and Greece, North Macedonia and Romania became the newest countries to see a case of the virus. South Korea announced 284 new cases, largely in Daegu, bringing its total to 1,261. China, still the epicenter of the crisis even as new outposts caught the world’s attention, reported 406 new cases and 52 more deaths. The country has a total of 78,604 cases of the virus and 2,715 fatalities.China said Wednesday that those sickened by the virus included 555 prisoners who officials said likely became infected by guards using the same bus station as a nearby pulmonary hospital. In a twist, China is now heavily regulating arrivals from abroad, with authorities placing South Koreans under monitoring, state broadcaster CCTV reported, after five people on a flight showed signs of fever. Indonesia said it evacuated 188 crew members from the World Dream cruise ship and planned to take them to remote Sebaru Island. The workers were released from quarantine in Hong Kong after finding no infections, but authorities mandated an additional observation period.And on the opposite side of the world, the MSC Meraviglia was denied permission to land in Grand Cayman, where it was due to arrive Wednesday, following a decision by Jamaica to refuse it entry. The cruise line expressed frustration with the moves, which came after it reported one crew member from the Philippines was sick with common seasonal flu.It brought reminders of the MS Westerdam, which was repeatedly denied entry to Asian ports before Cambodia welcomed its passengers.MSC Cruises said the Meraviglia was sailing onward to Mexico."

2eba976236e6554ed1defbcd80164b08,"Twitter flags Trump's tweet again, says it violates rules about 'glorifying violence'A defiant Twitter on Friday flagged a fresh tweet from Donald Trump for violating its rules against ""glorifying violence"", hours after the US president signed an executive order aimed at stripping social media giants like Twitter and Facebook of legal immunity for the content posted by third-party users.The move came after Trump tweeted that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" in reference to the ongoing unrest in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed African-American man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck.Twitter had earlier added fact-check links to two of Trump's tweets, enraging Trump.""These thugs are dishonouring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" Trump tweeted.Twitter flagged the tweet, which is now only visible if one clicks on Twitter's flag.""This Tweet violated the Twitter rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible,"" the social media company said.Floyd was seen pinned down in a video by a white police officer and later died.He could be heard screaming, ""I can't breathe,"" on the video of the incident.The video of Floyd's death has now caused outrage in the city of Minneapolis and all over the country. Residents of the city have been protesting his death since Tuesday.According to Twitter, it generally takes action on tweets that violate its rules.""However, we recognise that sometimes it may be in the public interest to allow people to view Tweets that would otherwise be taken down. We consider content to be in the public interest if it directly contributes to understanding or discussion of a matter of public concern,"" it said.""At present, we limit exceptions to one critical type of public-interest content—Tweets from elected and government officials—given the significant public interest in knowing and being able to discuss their actions and statements,"" it said.""As a result, in rare instances, we may choose to leave up a Tweet from an elected or government official that would otherwise be taken down,"" it said. The White House later dared Twitter by re-posting Trump's tweet. Twitter also flagged the re-posted tweet.Trump, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at stripping social media giants of legal immunity for the content posted by third-party users after Twitter added fact-check links to two of his tweets.The executive order calls for new regulations, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, to make it that social media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield.Trump on Friday again accused Twitter of targeting him and his supporters as he continued his attacks on social media platforms.""Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the radical left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives & the President of the United States. Section 230 should be revoked by Congress.

0be022bf3af03c546938c3e47375479d,"Millions of Americans gazed in wonder through telescopes, cameras and disposable protective glasses Monday as the moon blotted out the sun in the first full-blown solar eclipse to sweep the U.S. from coast to coast in nearly a century.“It’s really, really, really, really awesome,” said 9-year-old Cami Smith as she watched the fully eclipsed sun from a gravel lane near her grandfather’s home at Beverly Beach, Oregon.The temperature dropped, birds quieted down, crickets chirped and the stars came out in the middle of the day as the line of darkness raced 2,600 miles (4,200 kilometers) across the continent in about 90 minutes, bringing forth oohs, aahs, shouts and screams.Total Solar EclipseIn Boise, Idaho, where the sun was more than 99 percent blocked, people clapped and whooped, and the street lights came on briefly, while in Nashville, Tennessee, people craned their necks at the sky and knocked back longneck beers at Nudie’s Honky Tonk bar.It was the most-observed and most-photographed eclipse in history, with many Americans staking out prime viewing spots and settling onto blankets and lawn chairs to watch, especially along the path of totality — the line of deep shadow created when the sun is completely obscured except for the delicate ring of light known as the corona.Gallery: Millions Watch Historic Total Solar Eclipse Carving Its Path Across AmericaThe shadow — a corridor just 60 to 70 miles (96 to 113 kilometers) wide — came ashore in Oregon and then traveled diagonally across the heartland to South Carolina, with darkness from the totality lasting only about two to three wondrous minutes in any one spot.The rest of North America was treated to a partial eclipse, as were Central American and the top of South America.“We’re all part of something celestial — so much bigger than us, so mysterious,” said Ed Sullivan, who traveled from Richmond, Virginia, to Glendo Reservoir in Wyoming. “There is so much to ponder I don’t even know what questions to ask, but I enjoy just feeling the mystery.”Total Solar EclipseWith 200 million people within a day’s drive from the path of totality, towns and parks saw big crowds. Skies were clear along most of the route, to the relief of those who feared cloud cover would spoil this once-in-a-lifetime moment.“The show has just begun, people! What a gorgeous day! Isn’t this great, people?” Jim Todd, a director at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, told a crowd of thousands at an amphitheater in Salem, Oregon, as the moon took an ever-bigger bite out of the sun.NASA reported 4.4 million people were watching its TV coverage midway through the eclipse, the biggest livestream event in the space agency’s history.Total Solar Eclipse“It’s like nothing else you will ever see or ever do,” said veteran eclipse-watcher Mike O’Leary of San Diego, who set up his camera along with among hundreds of other amateur astronomers gathered in Casper, Wyoming. “It can be religious. It makes you feel insignificant, like you’re just a speck in the whole scheme of things.”Astronomers were giddy with excitement. A solar eclipse is considered one of the grandest of cosmic spectacles.NASA solar physicist Alex Young said the last time earthlings had a connection like this to the heavens was during man’s first flight to the moon, on Apollo 8 in 1968. The first, famous Earthrise photo came from that mission and, like this eclipse, showed us “we are part of something bigger.”Total Solar EclipseWith a half hour to go before totality, NASA’s acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot, enjoyed the moon’s “first bites out of the sun” from a plane flying over the Oregon coast and declared it “just an incredible view.”“I’m about to fight this man for a window seat,” Lightfoot said, referring to a fellow NASA official.NASA’s planetary science director, Jim Green, a usually talkative sort, managed an “Oh, wow!” when totality arrived in Idaho Falls, Idaho, and shouted: “There’s Venus! There’s Venus!”Total Solar EclipseHoping to learn more about the sun’s composition and activity, NASA and other scientists watched and analyzed from telescopes on the ground and in orbit, the International Space Station, airplanes and scores of high-altitude balloons beaming back live video.Citizen scientists also planned to monitor animal and plant behavior as day turned into twilight. Thousands of people streamed into the Nashville Zoo just to watch the animals’ reaction.The Earth, moon and sun line up perfectly every one to three years, briefly turning day into night for a sliver of the planet. But these sights normally are in no man’s land, like the vast Pacific or Earth’s poles. This is the first eclipse of the social media era to pass through such a heavily populated area.Total Solar EclipseThe moon hasn’t thrown this much shade at the U.S. since 1918, during the country’s last coast-to-coast total eclipse. In fact, the U.S. mainland hasn’t seen a total solar eclipse since 1979 — and even then, only five states in the Northwest experienced total darkness.The path of totality passed through 14 states, entering near Lincoln City, Oregon, at 1:16 p.m. EDT, moving over Casper, Wyoming; Carbondale, Illinois; and Nashville, Tennessee, and then exiting near Charleston, South Carolina, at 2:47 p.m. EDT.Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois saw the longest stretch of darkness: 2 minutes and 44 seconds.Total Solar EclipseJoe Roth, an amateur photographer, traveled south from the Chicago area to Alto Pass, Illinois, to catch his first total solar eclipse — on his 62nd birthday, no less. He said the stars aligned for him — “a Kodak moment for me to cherish and experience.”Kim Kniseley drove overnight from Roanoke, Virginia, arriving in Madisonville, Tennessee, before dawn to get a parking spot at Kefauver Park, where by sunrise dozens of folks had claimed benches and set up tents.He said he could have stayed home in Roanoke and seen a partial eclipse of 90 percent, but that would have been like “going to a rock concert and you’re standing in the parking lot.”Scientists warned people not to look into the sun without protection, except when the sun is 100 percent covered. To avoid eye damage, people were reminded to use special protective eyeglasses or pinhole projectors that can cast an image of the eclipse into a box.The next total solar eclipse in the U.S. will be in 2024. The next coast-to-coast one will not be until 2045."
a1604d5c71c12d2e9bc42edfb0de9407,"(Image for representation)The ex-wife of an Indian-origin neurologist in Singapore has been granted Singapore dollars 25 million in assets, child support and spousal support by a British Columbia court, in one of the biggest divorce payouts abroad.Gobinathan Devathasan, 69, whose behaviour was described as ""reprehensible"" during the litigation, was ordered on April 29 to pay his ex-wife Christie Devathasan Canadian dollars 5,498,344 in spousal support, with another Canadian dollars 612,084 for child support.During the course of the litigation, Mr Devathasan had handled funds in his Singapore bank account despite an asset freezing order, failed to disclose properties, deliberately embarrassed his daughter and suggested that a judge had ""spread her legs wide"" to the claimant's counsel, the court was told.The doctor ran a private clinic at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, and had married Christie in 1997. She filed for divorce in 2016, Channel News Asia reported.The couple was described in the court judgment as being ""uncommonly wealthy"", and had owned expensive cars, jewellery, artwork and homes, with investment properties in Canada, the US, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia.Christie divorced her first husband in 1996, while Mr Devathasan divorced his first wife, with whom he had two children with, in 1997. Shortly after, the couple got married in Singapore in August 1997.The couple's relationship deteriorated in 2015 and early 2016, according to the court papers.The divorce proceedings commenced in July 2016.Christie obtained an asset freezing order and a protection order, and these orders were served to Devathasan in August 2016. The doctor claimed that they were not binding as he was in Singapore and took steps to deal with his assets.Devathasan's past conduct was also taken into account in deciding ongoing and future child support. He has to pay Canadian dollars 33,084 for past child support and a lump sum of Canadian dollars 579,000 for child support for the period through to June 2022.""For a long time he was utterly unwilling to acknowledge or fulfill his parental and spousal responsibilities or acknowledge this court''s role in adjudicating those responsibilities,"" Justice Gomery said in his judgment.In an affidavit sworn on May 22, 2017, he stated: ""I will not pay a dollar for alimony now or till death or whatever any one decrees, no matter what"".The judge ordered Devathasan to pay his ex-wife Canadian dollars 2,351,000 in connection with the allocation of family property and debt. He will also have to pay a total of Canadian dollars 612,084 in child support, and Canadian dollars 5,498,344 in total for spousal support.The Canadian dollars 16.4 million in assets granted to Christie Devasthan include a house in West Vancouver worth Canadian dollars 6.2 million, an apartment in Vancouver worth Canadian dollars 2.35 million and an apartment in Florida worth Canadian dollars 2.48 million.The doctor was granted Canadian dollars 21.4 million after the proceedings.The judge described Devathasan as a ""hardworking man all his life"", adding that the doctor worked Monday to Friday and Saturday mornings throughout his career in private practices.""He has loyal patients,"" the judge was quoted as saying in the report."
edd1c3dcf2bdc75427dd53ee0ee445b4,"Vatican's Holy Week to proceed but without public amid virusThe Vatican's Holy Week ceremonies will go ahead but without public attendance as Italy tries to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the Holy See said Sunday. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that ""as far as Holy Week liturgical celebrations are concerned, I can specify that all are confirmed."" But Bruni added: ""As things stand, under study are the ways they would be carried out and who would participate while respecting the security measures put in place to avoid spread of the coronavirus."" He added that in any case, faithful will be able to follow the ceremonies on TV, radio and through online media.Holy Week begins with Palm Sunday on April 5, culminating on Easter Sunday a week later, with tradition calling for an outdoor Masses in St. Peter's Square on both Sundays. Tens of thousands of faithful usually turn out for the celebration.Italy is under severe lockdown, with the public restricted from leaving their homes except to buy food, go to work or a few other urgent reasons, and when outside must stay at least one meter (about three feet) away from each other. The disease for most people causes only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, it can cause more severe illness.It is not clear if the Italian decree's restrictions will be extended well into April. But fear of spreading the virus could also jeopardize the traditional Way of the Cross procession on Good Friday on April 10 at the Colosseum, even without the public.In any case, virus fears and travel restrictions by many countries toward Italy have made tourism virtually vanish.With St. Peter's Square closed to the public, and one case of infection reported by the Vatican recently, Pope Francis on Sunday delivered his traditional weekly commentary and blessing from the Apostolic Library instead of from a window overlooking the vast square. Francis praised priests for ""creativity"" in tending to their flocks, especially in the region of Lombardy, northern Italy, where thousands are hospitalized or in quarantine. He said their efforts demonstrated there are ""a thousand ways to be near"" to the faithful, if not physically.Some churches in Italy are being allowed to stay open for individual prayer, but all public Masses are forbidden during lockdown to discourage crowding.Francis didn't cite the Rev. Giuseppe Corbari, pastor of San Robbiano church in the town of Giussano, 10 kilometers (six miles) from Milan, but he well could have.Corbari printed all the selfies he received from faithful and attached them to the church pews, offering a vivid reminder of the powerful sense of community among Catholics.Francis did single out for praise the Milan archbishop, who last week went atop the roof of the city's iconic Duomo, or cathedral, to pray alone before a statue of the Madonna. As Spain followed Italy into lockdown mode to try and contain its own rapidly growing cases of COVID-19, churches in that similarly predominantly Roman Catholic country adopted measures akin to those done in Italy a few weeks ago. In Spain, faithful are allowed in the main chapel to pray but are given instructions to keep apart. Holy water bowls have been emptied. In one Madrid church, a confession room has been prepared since the usual confessional booths would mean the priest would be too close. In Germany, measures varied depending on the church and region. In heavily Catholic Bavaria, for example, the archdiocese of Munich canceled services through April 3, while the dioceses of Bamberg and Regensburg have restricted services to 100 people. The Lutheran church in the region plans to continue offering services, but with a larger space between worshippers.""It is a difficult situation and it cuts into our church life,"" Munich's Catholic archbishop, Reinhard Marx, said last week. But he added: ""This is not the end of prayer and pastoral care will still be there and present in urgent cases.""ALSO READ: Coronavirus halts life in Spain; over 2,000 cases reported in 24 hoursALSO READ: Coronavirus: France, Spain, Philippines amongst countries to announce more restrictions"
706f469b99d28c7d68e881bb530f7461,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during a press conference at the State Department, in Washington.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday said the United States is reviewing its global deployment of forces to ensure it is postured appropriately to counter the People's Liberation Army, given the increasing threat posed by China to Asian countries like India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.Pompeo said, ""We're going to make sure we're postured appropriately to counter the PLA. We think that the challenge of our times, and we're going to make sure we have resources in place to do that.""The Secretary of State was responding to a question during the virtual Brussels Forum 2020 of the German Marshall Fund.In the past two months, China has increased its activities at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), specifically in the Galwan Valley region in eastern Ladakh violating border norms by building military camps, trying to change the geography of the region. However, in the recent military-level talks between the two countries, China agreed to disengage in the Galwan region, a move that India is closely monitoring.The force posture review is being done at the direction of President Donald Trump, as part of which the US is reducing the number of its troops in Germany from about 52,000 to 25,000, he said. Pompeo said that the force posture would be dictated by the ground realities.""In certain places there will be fewer American resources. There'll be other places - I just talked about the threat from the Chinese Communist Party, so now threats to India, threats to Vietnam, threats to Malaysia, Indonesia, South China Sea challenges, the Philippines,"" he said.""To the extent that changed, the difference in what the US decided to do impacts adversely a threat some place, it may be that other nations need to step up and take responsibility for their own defense in ways that they hadn't done previously. So, we want to do this in full consultation with all of our partners all around the world, and certainly our friends in Europe,"" Pompeo said.President Trump is being criticised for reducing troops from Germany. His critics say that this will increase the threat from Russia to Europe. Pompeo, however, did not agree with that argument.It has been a long time since there has been a strategic review of our force posture all across the world. The US undertook that starting about 2.5 years ago, whether that was our forces in Africa, our forces in Asia, the force we have in the Middle East and in Europe, he said.""We began to say these are often decisions that were made in a different time. Should we reallocate those a different way? Should we have a different composition of those forces? Everyone always wants to talk about ground troops. I get it. I was a young tank officer. You described that. There's nothing I like as much as a good M1 tank.""But it's often the case that the capacity to deter Russia or other adversaries isn't determined any longer by just having a bunch of folks garrisoned someplace. So, we really went to back fundamentally relook, what is the nature of the conflict, what's the nature of the threat, and how should we allocate our resources, whether that's our resources in the intelligence community, our resources from the Air Force or the Marines and Army,"" Pompeo said.Last week, Pompeo criticised the Chinese Army for ""escalating"" the border tension with India and militarising the strategic South China Sea. He also described the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) as a ""rogue actor.""""Our broad set of allocation of security apparatus, our ability to counter cyber threats, how do we allocate them? What's the best way to do this? And the decision that you see the president made with respect to Germany is an outcome from a collective set of decisions about how we're going to posture our resources around the world,"" said the top American diplomat on Thursday.Changes in force posture is being taken in consultations with allies and friends, Pompeo said.""President Trump has spoken to this. (Defense ) Secretary (Mark) Esper will be in London today and in Brussels tomorrow. We'll talk about our plan and how we're thinking about delivering it,"" he said.""But you should understand this, and I hope our European partners will understand this as well. When you see what we ultimately conclude, how we ultimately deliver on the statements of the president made, that they're aimed squarely at what we believe to be democracies' fundamental interest and certainly America's most fundamental interest,"" Pompeo said.Earlier this month, Pompeo had said that China's actions, be it on the India border, or in Hong Kong or in the South China Sea, were part of the behaviour of the ruling Communist Party in Beijing in the recent past.China has been fast expanding military and economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region, triggering concern in various countries of the region and beyond.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea.

Russia's Charge d'affaires Roman Babushkin said India has a deep understanding of the reasons that led to the current situation in Ukraine and Moscow is looking for continued support from New Delhi in sync with the special and privileged strategic partnership between the two countries.The UN Security Council is scheduled to vote on Friday evening on a draft resolution on Russia's military operation in Ukraine as well as the escalating situation in the eastern European country. ""We highly appreciate India's deep understanding of the current situation as well as the reasons that led to it. We expect India to support Russia at the UN Security Council,"" Babushkin told PTI.The draft resolution is set to condemn in the strongest terms Russia's military operation in Ukraine that has triggered strong outrage among the Western powers. Appreciating India's position, the Russian diplomat also referred to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's comments three days back in Paris that the situation in Ukraine has its roots in the post-Soviet politics and the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).""India's position has been very balanced and independent. We appreciate it and we continue to expect India's support in sync with the special and privileged strategic partnership between the two countries,"" Babushkin said. When asked at a media briefing on Thursday about India's position on the draft UN Security Council resolution on the Ukraine crisis, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said India has seen it and that New Delhi's stand will depend on the final shape of its text.""I am told that it would undergo considerable changes. We will wait to see the shape that the resolution takes before we can pronounce ourselves and the position that we will take on the issue,"" the foreign secretary said. The Russian Charge d'affaires said Russia has been in constant touch with India over the latest developments relating to Ukraine.""We are maintaining all communication with India and it has a proper understanding of the overall situation,"" he said. In the midst of the escalating situation in Ukraine, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a telephonic conversation with President Vladimir Putin on Thursday during which he appealed for ending violence, and called for concerted efforts from all sides to return to the path of diplomatic dialogue.A Russian readout said Putin outlined the fundamental assessments of Ukraine's ""aggressive actions"" against the civilian population of Donbas as well as the many years of ""destructive policy"" aimed at breaking the Minsk agreements. Jaishankar too held a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov and underlined that dialogue and diplomacy are the best way forward to deal with the crisis.Babushkin said the Western powers and the current Ukrainian government were responsible for the Russian action against Ukraine as they never heeded to Russia's security concerns as well as legitimate interests of the people of Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) in Ukraine.Also Read | Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine’s nuclear agency reports increased radiation levels from ChernobylAlso Read | Russia Ukraine war: Air India planning to operate two flights to Romania to evacuate Indians "

Some of the travellers (from these two countries) are our citizens, permanent residents or their close relatives (who come) here to visit them,"" TODAY newspaper had Dr Koh as responding to a parliamentary question on why the government is not closing the nation's borders to India and Indonesia, given the ""disproportionately large number of imported cases from these two countries"".Dr Koh explained that Singapore needs a continued inflow of migrant workers to support key sectors of the economy, including construction workers to build housing projects and critical infrastructure, and foreign domestic workers to support the caregiving needs of families. Dr Koh said that less than one per cent of Singapore's total foreign arrivals since April 1 last year has tested positive for COVID-19.In recent months, most COVID-19 cases have been foreigners arriving here to work. Most of the arrivals since then were from mainland China, Indonesia, India and Malaysia.Meanwhile, according to a report by TODAY, the Ministry of Manpower had approved around 25,000 requests for foreign domestic workers to enter Singapore between April last year, a starting period of sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, and January this year.A 34-year-old foreign domestic worker from Indonesia is Singapore's sole imported COVID-19 case on Tuesday (Feb 16). This is the lowest number for imported cases reported here since November 2, which recorded one infection then, reported TODAY.The Ministry of Health (MOH) said that the work permit holder had already been placed on stay-home notice upon her arrival here on February 2. She was tested for the coronavirus while serving quarantine. The woman's serology test has come back positive, which is indicative that hers is like a past infection.""However, as she did not undergo a serology test upon arrival in Singapore, we are not able to definitively conclude that she was no longer infectious when she arrived... As a precautionary measure, we will take all the necessary public health actions,"" the MOH said.From Feb 5, newly arrived work permit and S-Pass holders in the construction, marine and process sectors, who had recent travel history to higher-risk countries and regions, were required to undergo mandatory on-arrival polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology tests.Singapore has recorded 59,810 COVID-19 infections so far, while 59,661 people have fully recovered and been discharged, including 20 on Tuesday.

According to the details, the gunman was wearing military gear and was live streaming with a helmet camera. The authorities described the attack as “racially motived violent extremism"".“He exited his vehicle. He was very heavily armed. He had tactical gear. He had a tactical helmet on. He had a camera that he was live streaming what he was doing,” city Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said at a news conference.Gramaglia said the gunman initially shot four people outside the store, three fatally. Inside the store, a security guard who was a retired Buffalo police officer fired multiple shots at the gunman and struck him, but the bullet hit the gunman’s bulletproof vest and had no effect, Gramaglia added. The commissioner said the gunman then killed the security guard.Video also captured the suspect as he walked into the supermarket where he shot several other victims inside, according to authorities.Gramaglia said Buffalo police entered the store and confronted the gunman in the vestibule.The suspected gunman was later identified as Payton Gendron, of Conklin, a New York state community about 200 miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Buffalo, two law enforcement officials said. The officials were not permitted to speak publicly on the matter and did so on the condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, Gendron was arraigned in court Saturday evening on first-degree murder charges and ordered detained without bail.

7c8d5073aebf39119e2e63e111a67dec,"Imran Khan-led govt's days are numbered: warns Pak cleric Fazlur RehmanFirebrand cleric-cum-politician Maulana Fazlur Rehman has fired a fresh salvo at Prime Minister Imran Khan, saying the ""Gorbachev of Pakistan"" was heading a government that has its days numbered. Speaking at a sit-in in Bannu city in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Tuesday, the hard-line cleric and leader of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) hit out at the prime minister for calling opposition leaders ""thieves"", alleging that the ""selected"" government has offered National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) to Khan's sister. Rehman claimed the time for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government led by Khan was running out.""The roots of this government have been cut. They have only a number of days left,"" Rehman warned. ""Imran Khan has given his sister an NRO. Give us a similar sewing machine which can earn you Rs 70 billion in one year,"" he was quoted as saying by the Geo News.National Reconciliation Ordinance was an ordinance issued in October 2007 granting pardon to politicians, political workers and bureaucrats accused of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder, and terrorism.Rehman said Khan was trying to be the ""Gorbachev of Pakistan"". He used the same expression to describe Khan earlier this month when he gave the prime minister two days deadline to tender his resignation.The JUI-F chief was responding to Khan's tirade from the previous day where he labelled Rehman's anti-government protest as a ""circus"".Prime Minister Khan said on Monday that a ""circus"" took place in Islamabad in the name of 'Azadi March' protest. He said the protesters could not even stay for a month in the capital as opposed to his party's 2014 protest of 126 days. Khan said the opposition leaders had ulterior motives, which is why they resorted to dharna politics on containers.Earlier, Rehman led a massive anti-government protest rally, dubbed 'Azadi March', aimed at toppling the incumbent government. The firebrand cleric had lambasted the government for failing on key domestic and foreign policy fronts. He said only Pakistan's economy was going down whereas the economies of all other regional countries were going up.Rehman launched his protest on October 27 from Karachi and arrived in Islamabad on October 31, leading a caravan of tens of thousands of followers. He repeatedly said that the protestors would stay until Khan resigned and new elections were announced. The government also engaged him in talks but failed to make any headway as he refused to budge from the key demand of resignation of the Prime Minister. Despite failure to achieve the objective immediately, it is believed that he gained politically by showing his power to assemble large crowds. The discipline and peace of the protestors were also acknowledged even by his opponents.The opposition parties, including the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan People Party (PPP), had also thrown their weight behind the massive anti-government rally comprising thousands of protesters in Islamabad. Rehman claimed on Tuesday that the protest had achieved its target and added the JUI-F did not go to the federal capital without any purpose. ALSO READ | JUI-F chief seeks opinion on 'Plan B' of Azadi MarchALSO READ | I hold no grudge against Nawaz Sharif, says Imran Khan"
237c04bea5610764e4c23d8b1e0cf757,"Two weeks after fighting together against the Islamic State, Iraqi forces pushed their Kurdish allies out of the disputed city of Kirkuk on Monday, seizing oil fields and other facilities amid soaring tensions over last month’s Kurdish vote for independence.The move by the Iraqi military and its allied militias so soon after neutralizing the Islamic State in northern Iraq hinted at a country that could once again turn on itself after disposing of a common enemy.Related Stories Iraq must stop IS 2.0, says US commanderIraq says it has retaken northern town from Islamic StateIraqi Kurds send reinforcements to disputed KirkukCivilians and federal troops pulled down Kurdish flags around the city. Kurdish Gov. Najmaddin Karim, who had stayed at his post despite being dismissed by Baghdad weeks ago, fled to Irbil, the capital of Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish zone.Revelers waving Iraq’s national flag and the flag of its Turkmen minority flooded central Kirkuk in an evening celebration. But it was the Shiite sectarian chants heard above the din of the rally that underscored the coming political battles between Iraq and its Kurdish region.Iraqi forces were supported — as they always are now in major operations — by the country’s Popular Mobilization Forces, a predominantly Shiite militia coalition that the Kurds see as an instrument of Iranian policy.In their bid to keep Kirkuk and its oil-rich countryside, Kurdish leaders whipped up fears that the central government in Baghdad is dominated by Tehran and would oppress Kurds if they recaptured the ethnically mixed city.Their fears were further affirmed after Iran came out forcefully against the Kurdish region’s nonbinding referendum for independence on Sept. 25 and then closed its official crossings to the region on Sunday.Iraq’s Kurds, too, remember the brutal campaigns waged by Saddam Hussein, himself an enemy of Tehran, against the minority, including a poison gas attack on the town of Halabja in 1988 that killed thousands.As Arab and Turkmen revelers celebrated the change of power in Kirkuk, thousands of Kurdish residents, fearful of federal and militia rule, packed the roads north to Irbil.But Baghdad was eyeing its Kurdish partners warily as well. Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi said he was reclaiming a city that was never within the legal boundaries of the Kurdish autonomous region.When Iraq’s armed forces crumbled in the face of an advance by Islamic State group in 2014, Kurdish forces moved into Kirkuk to secure the city and its surrounding oil wells. The city is 32 kilometers (20 miles) outside the Kurds’ autonomous region in northeast Iraq.Baghdad insisted the city and its province be returned, but matters came to a head when the Kurdish authorities expanded their referendum to include Kirkuk. To the Iraqi central government, that looked like a provocation that underscored what it sees as unchecked Kurdish expansionism. The city of more than 1 million is home to a mix of Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen, as well as Christians and Sunni and Shiite Muslims.Kurdish officials accused the Iraqi army of carrying out a “major, multiprong attack,” and reported heavy clashes on Kirkuk’s outskirts, but a spokesman for Iraq’s state-backed militias said they were met by little resistance.By midday, federal forces had moved into several major oil fields north of the city, as well as its airport and an important military base, according to Iraqi commanders. Kurdish party headquarters inside Kirkuk had been abandoned.The U.S., which has armed, trained and provided vital air support to both sides in their shared struggle against the Islamic State group, described Monday’s events as “coordinated movements, not attacks,” while bemoaning the dispute as a distraction against a common enemy. It said the limited exchange of fire was a “misunderstanding.”After initial reports of clashes in and around the city, it appeared by afternoon as though the vastly outnumbered Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, were pulling out with hardly a fight.Local police stayed in place in Kirkuk as al-Abadi urged civil servants to remain at their posts. “We have only acted to fulfill our constitutional duty and extend the federal authority and impose security and protect the national wealth in this city,” he said.Brig. Gen. Bahzad Ahmed, a spokesman for Kurdish forces, said federal forces seized an oil and gas company and other industrial areas south of Kirkuk in fighting with Kurdish forces that caused “lots of casualties,” without providing a number.He said Iraqi forces have “burnt lots of houses and killed many people” south of the disputed city. His claims could not be independently verified.A spokesman for Iraq’s state-sanctioned militias said they had “achieved all our goals” in retaking areas from Kurdish forces in and around the city. Ahmed al-Assadi said federal forces came under fire from “some rebels” after launching the operation early Monday and returned fire. He did not say whether they suffered any casualties.He said federal forces were deployed in the area of the K-1 military base, the Kirkuk airport and a number of oil fields and installations. The Iraqi military said it seized two major oil fields outside the city.Al-Assadi said the Popular Mobilization Forces have not entered central Kirkuk, but Associated Press reporters saw Turkmen PMF militiamen taking up posts in the western part of the city.Tensions have risen since the Kurdish referendum on independence from Iraq. The central government, along with neighboring Turkey and Iran, as well as the United States, rejected the vote.The central government and the autonomous Kurdish region have long been at odds over sharing oil revenue and the fate of disputed territories like Kirkuk that are controlled by Kurdish forces but outside the self-ruled region.Al-Abadi has said the militias will remain outside the city.Baghdad has been increasing pressure on the region since the referendum, pushing Kurdish leaders to disavow the vote and accept shared administration over Kirkuk.Al-Abadi’s Cabinet said Sunday that fighters from Turkey’s Kurdish insurgency, the PKK, were beginning to appear in Kirkuk, and he declared that would be tantamount to an act of war."
c164ba7ab6da780bd3aa36f55918438c,"President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House, Wednesday, April 22, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)President Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that he had signed an executive order “temporarily suspending immigration into the United States.” But experts say the order will merely delay the issuance of green cards for a minority of immigrants. Trump said his move, announced in a Monday tweet, was necessary to help Americans get back to work in an economy ravaged by the coronavirus. “This will ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens,” he said.But the order includes a long list of exemptions, including for those who are currently in the country and those seeking entry to work as physicians and nurses, as well as the spouses and minor children of American citizens. The 60-day pause also leaves untouched the hundreds of thousands of temporary work visas the country issues each year.That left partisans on both sides of the immigration battle suggesting the order was driven more by politics than policy during an election year.Trump ran in 2016 on promising to crack down on both illegal and legal immigration, making the case — disputed by many — that foreign workers compete with Americans for jobs and drive down wages because they are willing to accept lower pay. While many of Trump’s efforts to dramatically upend the nation’s immigration system, from travel bans to asylum restrictions, had been stymied by Congress and the courts, the pandemic has allowed him to move forward on certain changes. Like other world leaders, Trump has restricted travel from much of the globe, including China and large swaths of Europe. The borders with Mexico and Canada have been closed to all but “essential” travel.With consulates closed, almost all visa processing by the State Department has been suspended for weeks. And Trump has used the virus to effectively end asylum at U.S. borders, turning away migrants, including children, by invoking a rarely used 1944 law aimed at preventing the spread of communicable diseases.The green card measure will limit the ability of current green card holders to sponsor their extended families — a practice Trump has derided as “chain immigration” and tried to restrict.The final version was far less drastic than advocates on both sides of the issue had expected after Trump posted a tweet late Monday that sent businesses, would-be immigrants and administration officials scrambling.“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” Trump wrote.Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said before the order was released that it would “have some very modest policy effect,” but he said “it’s actually not even that big a deal.” He said “the primary function was political, to respond to people’s concern that at this point, with maybe 15% of the labor force out of work, they had to do something.”Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a liberal immigration reform group, agreed in part.“This announcement is more about grabbing a headline than changing immigration policy,” he said Wednesday. “To me, it smacks of an electoral strategy, not a policy change, and it smacks of desperation and panic.”Omar Jadwat, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, accused Trump of launching a “transparent attempt to distract from his own failures” that “will cause real pain for families and employers across the country.”Pivoting to immigration is a strategy Trump has used before. He often turns to immigration when he feels backed into a corner and is looking for an issue to rev up his base.Ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, for instance, Trump put immigration at the forefront, using migrant caravans in Latin America as a rallying cry as he ordered thousands of U.S. troops to the southern border to stop an “invasion.” He also floated ending the Constitution’s guarantee of birthright citizenship.In recent days, officials bolstered by their successful efforts to restrict travel at the country’s borders had been discussing how they might seize the opportunity to enact additional immigration restrictions. Trump’s tweet nonetheless took many across the administration by surprise.During the coronavirus crisis, Trump has found other ways to pivot to immigration. He used one of his task force briefings to highlight enhanced counternarcotics efforts to prevent smugglers from taking advantage of the pandemic — though he said there was no evidence of that — and has repeatedly invoked his border wall.“In the meantime, even without this order, our Southern Border, aided substantially by the 170 miles of new Border Wall & 27,000 Mexican soldiers, is very tight - including for human trafficking!” he tweeted Wednesday. Trump’s team on Tuesday, however, denied he was using the virus to make good on a long-standing campaign promise during an election year.“This is common sense the American people can very well understand: When Americans need jobs, Americans must come first,” said White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany.“The president’s immigration policy just makes sense,” agreed Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh. With 22 million Americans applying for unemployment, he asked, “Why would you in good conscience introduce brand-new competition for them?”Trump’s campaign showcased the move in an email blast to supporters that read: “PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND IMMIGRATION.”"

468154a8757d9ff7577709456d52fc3a,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law that allows the government to list any foreign media operating in the country as a foreign agent.The bill, in retaliation for Kremlin-backed broadcaster RT being told to register as a foreign agent in the US, was earlier approved by the Parliament, BBC reported on Saturday.At least nine US-funded broadcasters, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty could be hit.RT is accused of being part of Russia's alleged meddling in the US election. The broadcaster denies the claim.The new Russian law affects foreign-registered media outlets which receive funding from outside Russia.They are now subject to additional requirements and failure to meet them could result in the suspension of their activities.If they are required to register, they will have to say in their broadcasts and on their websites that they are foreign agents.A similar law already exists targeting charities and other civil society groups.Russia's justice ministry can now decide which outlets the steps applied to and under what circumstances.RT said last week it had registered as a foreign agent in the US following a request by the Department of Justice.The instruction came under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), adopted in 1938 to counter pro-Nazi agitation on US soil and applied to those engaged in political activity for a foreign government.The measure would require RT to label anything it produces, making it clear its reports are distributed on behalf of the Russian state. The broadcaster said it would challenge the requirement in court.Russia has denied it interfered in last year's US presidential election."

However, their forces in Chumbi Valley are still deployed and I expect them to withdraw as their exercise in the area gets over,"" Dhanoa told reporters.The 73-day Dokalam standoff started on June 16 when Chinese troops attempted to build a road in territory claimed by Bhutan close to the Indian border. Indian troops objected to it and stopped the Chinese from building the road. The standoff was finally resolved on August 28. "

Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, also known as the Gurdwara Janam Asthan, is the site where the first Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Nanak, was born. It is regarded as one of the holiest Sikh sites. Foreign Office in a midnight statement said the provincial authorities in the Punjab province have informed that there was a scuffle in the city of Nankana Sahib on Friday between two Muslim groups.The altercation happened on a minor incident at a tea-stall and the District Administration immediately intervened and arrested the accused.""Attempts to paint this incident as a communal issue are patently motivated. Most importantly, the Gurdwara remains untouched and undamaged. All insinuations to the contrary, particularly the claims of acts of ‘desecration and destruction’ and desecration of the holy place, are not only false but also mischievous,” said the FO.It said the Government of Pakistan was committed to upholding law and order and providing security and protection to the people, especially the minorities.The opening of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor is a manifestation of Pakistan's special care extended to the minorities, in line with the vision of the Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, it said.According to some Indian media reports, a mob attack took place at the shrine.

The international community should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Maldives and provide support and convenience for dialogue between the relevant parties and play a constructive role in this aspect.""The Chinese stand to provide outside support for the parties is seen as a slight change in Beijing's position.Opposition parties in the Maldives allege China is backing President Abdulla Yameen who has permitted several high-profile Chinese-backed infrastructure projects and signed a controversial Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China despite domestic opposition.Geng's comments came as Yameen dispatched special envoys to ""friendly countries"" like China, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The special envoy for China is expected to arrive here later today.Geng said, ""China thinks that the current situation and disputes in the Maldives belong to its internal affairs. It should be properly resolved though consultations by relevant parties. The international community should respect the Maldives' sovereignty and territorial integrity and play a constructive role for dialogue between the relevant parties.""China, he said is willing to maintain close communication with relevant parties in Maldives to restore normal order as soon as possible.Asked whether it means China is in touch with former president Mohamed Nasheed who is bitterly critical of China's role in the Maldives, Geng said, ""We are maintaining close communication with relevant parties in the Maldives and the diplomatic channels between two countries is also smooth.""But at the same time, Geng refuted allegations by Sri Lanka-based Nasheed who has accused China of land grab and undermining the Maldives' sovereignty and security in the Indo-Pacific. Nasheed also called for Indian military intervention to end the crisis.Yesterday, Geng said China is opposed to any outside military intervention in Maldives in response to Nasheed's call.""I think that kind of remarks (by Nasheed) is totally wrong. When Nasheed was president China has offered assistance to Maldives and promoted pragmatic cooperation and has achieved a lot of outcomes. I don't know whether Nasheed will regard such cooperation as grabbing,"" he said.Based on mutual respect and equality, the Maldives has maintained cooperation on infrastructure and livelihood projects and China has made contribution to the transformation of economic structure and improvement of livelihoods of people of the Maldives, Geng said while defending China's massive investments in the picturesque islands in the Indian Ocean.""China has not attached political strings for cooperation with the Maldives. China will never endanger the independence of the Maldives. Friendly cooperation is for all the people in the Maldives and it serves the interest of the two countries and two peoples,"" he said.Besides India, the US, the UN, and the EU have all expressed concern over Yameen jailing the Supreme Court judges and 81-year-old former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom besides a number of opposition legislators.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday urged the Maldives government to uphold the rule of law and ensure the safety of the people of the island nation.The UN chief expressed serious concern about the unfolding situation in the Maldives and, in a statement issued by his spokesman Stephane Dujarric, urged the government to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law, lift the state of emergency as soon as possible, and take all measures to ensure the safety and security of the people in the country.China views the Maldives as key to its Maritime Silk Road project in the Indian Ocean as it has already acquired Hambantota port in Sri Lanka and Djibouti in the Horn of Africa.Also China today further strengthened its travel advisory to thousands of Chinese tourists by asking travel agencies not to organise group tours to the Maldives during the week-long Chinese New Year holiday this month.Geng in his briefing referred to the China Travel Bureau's warnings to travel agencies about group tours.Earlier, China had asked its tourists to cancel plans to visit the Maldives which is a favourite tourist destination. Tourism is the Maldives' biggest industry. It accounts for around a fifth of its GDP and generates billions of dollars every year in revenue. In 2016, the sector was worth almost USD 9 billion.   About 1.4 million people visited the Indian Ocean archipelago last year, of which Chinese tourists constituted about 30 per cent. The Chinese New Year was stated to be biggest season for tourists from China to visit the Maldives."

45c9944aedde5f8623b228492d29be8a,"US President Donald TrumpUS President Donald Trump on Monday reimposed sanctions on Iran, which were lifted as part of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. However, he stated that the United States is open to forge new nuclear deal with Tehran. Signing the executive order, President Trump said that the US policy is to levy 'maximum economic pressure' on the country.Related Stories 'Progress of talks between US, Iran will augur well for India'As tension mounts, Trump says he is ready to meet Iranian President Rouhani 'without any precondition'Iran will not negotiate under pressure, particularly with US: Foreign MinistryUS to reimpose sanctions on Iran after exit from 2015 nuclear deal In a statement, Trump said the 2015 international accord to freeze Iran’s nuclear program in return for lifting sanctions was a “horrible, one-sided deal” and said it left the Iranian government flush with cash to use to fuel conflict in the Middle East.“We urge all nations to take such steps to make clear that the Iranian regime faces a choice: either change its threatening, destabilizing behavior and reintegrate with the global economy, or continue down a path of economic isolation,” Trump said.Trump warned that those who don’t wind down their economic ties to Iranian “risk severe consequences” under the reimposed sanctions.A first phase of US sanctions against Iran goes into effect overnight, targeting Iran's access to US banknotes and key industries including cars and carpets.The second phase, which takes effect November 5 and will block Iran's oil sales, is due to cause more damage, though several countries including China, India and Turkey have indicated they are not willing to entirely cut their Iranian energy purchases.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the renewed US sanctions on Iran will be rigorously enforced and remain in place until the Iranian government radically changes course.Speaking to reporters en route from a three-nation trip to Southeast Asia, Pompeo said Monday’s reimposition of some sanctions is an important pillar in US policy toward Iran. He said the Trump administration is open to looking beyond sanctions but that would “require enormous change” from Tehran.“We’re hopeful that we can find a way to move forward but it’s going to require enormous change on the part of the Iranian regime,” he said on Sunday. “They’ve got to behave like a normal country. That’s the ask. It’s pretty simple"", he added.Meanwhile European foreign ministers lashed out the United States and said thay they “deeply regret” the reimposition of US sanctions on Iran.A statement by European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and foreign ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom insisted that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal “is working and delivering on its goal” of limiting Iran’s nuclear program.The ministers said the Iran deal is “crucial for the security of Europe, the region and the entire world.”A senior administration official said the United States is “not particularly concerned” by EU efforts to protect European firms from the reimposition of sanctions.The official was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke Monday on condition of anonymity.The European Union issued a “blocking statute” Monday to protect European businesses from the impact of the sanctions.The new order has affected the Iran's currency, which has lost around half its value since Trump's announcement. It has added to tensions inside Iran, which has seen days of protests and strikes in multiple towns and cities over water shortages, high prices and wider anger at the political system.Hitting back, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani struck a hard line demanding compensation for decades of American “intervention” in the Islamic Republic.While saying he had “no preconditions” for talks, Rouhani in a live television interview maintained that Iran can rely on China and Russia to help its oil and banking sectors as the U.S. ramps up sanctions in the coming months.The U.S. resumed sanctions targeting Iran’s automotive sector as well as gold and other key metals on Monday.“If someone has knife in the hand and seeks talks, he should first put the knife in his pocket,” Rouhani said.The uncertainty caused by the re-imposition of American sanctions has proven devastating for the Iranian economy, already weakened by decades of sanctions. Iran’s rial now trades over double its government-set rate to the U.S. dollar. Sporadic protests have broken out across the country, something that Rouhani again blamed Monday on the US.“The Americans thought that they can add to our social and economic problems through increasing pressure,” he said. "

Officials did not say the total number of people injured including police and civilians.Dozens of first responder vehicles converged on the building housing the company in Aurora after police received multiple calls about an active shooter at 1:24 p.m. CST.Several ATF teams also responded to the shooting and were at the scene, according to the agency’s Chicago spokeswoman, and the FBI said it also responded.John Probst, an employee at the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora, told ABC7 that he ran out of the back door as the shooting unfolded Friday afternoon. Probst says he recognized the gunman and that he works for the company.“What I saw was the guy running down the aisle with a pistol with a laser on it,” Probst said.Probst said he wasn’t hurt but that another colleague was “bleeding pretty bad.”  “It’s a shame that mass shootings such as this have become commonplace in our country. It’s a shame that a cold and heartless offender would be so selfish as to think he has the right to take an innocent life,” Aurora Mayor Richard C. Irvin said.Police and squad cars guarded all access points to Henry Pratt five hours after the first calls to 911 about the shooting. The industrial park is surrounded by a neighborhood of modest homes with porch fronts, some with American flags perched outside.At Acorn Woods Condominiums where Martin lived, a mix of brick apartments and condos nestled on a quiet street just a mile and a half from the shooting, neighbors gathered on sidewalks near Martin’s unit talking and wondering among themselves if they knew or had come in contact with him.Mary McKnight stepped out of her car with a cherry cheesecake purchased for her son’s birthday, to find a flurry of police cars, officers and media trucks.“This is a strange thing to come home to, right,” she said. She had just learned that the shooter lived close by and his unit in the complex had been taped off by police.Christy Fonseca often worries about some of the gang-related crimes and shootings around her mother’s Aurora neighborhood. But she never expected the type of phone call she got from her mom on Friday, warning her to be careful with an active shooter loose in the town.Police cars with screaming sirens revved past her as she drove to her mother’s house, where the Henry Pratt building is visible from the porch stoop. it was only when they flipped on the television news that they realized Martin had killed people just a few hundred feet away.“In Aurora, period, we’d never thought anything like this would happen,” Fonseca, a lifelong resident of the Chicago suburb, said as she looked out at the factory.The White House said President Donald Trump was briefed on the shooting and monitoring the situation as he prepared to depart for a weekend trip to his home in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump tweeted his thanks to law enforcement officers in Aurora and offered his condolences to the victims and their families. “America is with you,” he said. Presence Mercy Medical Center was treating two patients and a third had been transferred by helicopter to another hospital, spokesman Matt Wakely said. Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital and Advocate Lutheran General Hospital each had one patient from the shooting, spokeswoman Kate Eller said. Rush Copley Medical Center received three patients from the shooting and all are being treated for non-life threatening injuries, spokeswoman Courtney Satlak said."
a73238bf620dd04cc3284c2fd2ae0632,"15-year-old charged for Chicago shooting on HalloweenA 15-year-old boy was charged Friday night with attempted murder in the suspected gang-related shooting of two people on Chicago’s West Side, including a 7-year-old girl out trick-or-treating in a bumblebee costume when she was shot in the neck and critically injured.The shooting Thursday night was another grim example of children in the city being caught in the crossfire while doing normal activities like walking down the street, sitting on a porch or laughing with friends inside a house. A day before Halloween, an earlier shooting of a child resurfaced in the news when a jury acquitted a man who was charged with first-degree murder in the 2014 death of an 11-year-old girl who was shot while inside a house at a slumber party.Investigators think the 7-year-old girl was shot in a gang-related attack. The man believed to be the target was a 30-year-old shot in the hand, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.The 15-year-old was charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of battery through discharge of a firearm, police said in a news release Friday night. He was taken into custody and interviewed earlier Friday.The Chicago Tribune reported police believe the gunman is a member of the Gangster Two-Six gang and was targeting a member of the Latin Kings.The girl was trick-or-treating as a group of males chased a man down the street in the Little Village neighborhood. Someone in the group opened fire, police said.“This is unacceptable,” Sgt. Rocco Alioto said. “A 7-year-old girl that was trick-or-treating with her family had to get shot because a group of guys want to shoot at another male.”The shooter had on a mask like the one the character Jason wears in the “Friday the 13th” movies, Guglielmi said, adding that investigators had found a gun that might be the weapon used in the shooting.The girl was shot in the lower neck and rushed to a hospital in critical condition, according to Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford. She was in critical but stable condition Friday, Guglielmi said.The wounded man, who was shot in his left hand, was taken to a hospital in good condition.The shooting came on a night where children typically crowd the streets. But in Chicago, because of snowy weather, the number of children trick-or-treating was smaller than normal.The girl was one of several people shot in U.S. cities during Halloween night activities. In the San Francisco Bay area community of Orinda, California, police said four people were killed in a shooting at a party. And in the eastern Utah community of Roosevelt, one man was fatally shot and a second man was stabbed to death at a party.Investigators in the Chicago shooting received several tips from the public in the hours after the gunfire, and police recovered surveillance video that detectives believe shows people involved in the shooting or people who know those who were involved.ALSO READ | Over 300 flights cancelled as Chicago receives heavy snowfallALSO READ | Shooting in Chicago: Gunman opens fire on 100 people at a street party, 6 injured"

6fe28552df5e091b8c5a7e3db2d76b4a,"Hours after former FBI director James Comey testified in front of Congress on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that “we’re under siege” but will emerge “bigger and better and stronger than ever.” Talking to his evangelical supporters at Faith and Freedom Coalition’s annual gathering, Trump said, “We will always support our evangelical community and defend your right and the right of all Americans to follow and to live by the teachings of their faith.” “And as you know, we’re under siege, you understand that. But we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever. You watch,” the president told more than 1,000 activists meeting at a hotel across town from Capitol Hill, the scene of Comey’s nationally televised testimony. “You fought hard for me and now I’m fighting hard for all of you,” Trump said. Trump made no reference to James Comey in his remarks to the gathering. But hours before the president’s first public comments of the day, Comey told the Senate intelligence committee that Trump tried to get him to pledge loyalty and drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.Trump abruptly fired Comey last month. Trump’s attorney said the president never asked Comey to stop investigating anyone.Trump's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz read a prepared statement to reporters in response to Comey's testimony, in which he said the president had ""never, in form or substance"" directed Comey to stop investigating anyone.He also labeled Comey a leaker, accusing him of ""unauthorized disclosures"" of ""privileged communications"" he'd had with the president.Trump, who spent time meeting with Kasowitz after returning from the speech, also declined to answer shouted questions about the testimony at a panel with governors and local government leaders who had come to the White House to talk infrastructure.Trump, said one person familiar with his thinking, felt good about the testimony, which proved him right in several cases and included the revelation that Comey had leaked information to reporters. The person spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the president's thinking.In a rare show of self-restraint, Trump stayed off Twitter Thursday as Comey testified before the Senate intelligence committee, while his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted more than 80 times, defending his father and blasting the former FBI director. Trump Jr. in particular seized on Comey's assertion that he interpreted the president's statement that he ""hoped"" the FBI would drop its probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn as an instruction.""Knowing my father for 39 years when he 'orders or tells' you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means,"" Trump Jr. wrote.He also pointed to Comey's revelation that he had asked a friend to pass along to the press memos he had written documenting his interactions with Trump.""Did I miss something or did Comey just say he asked a friend to leak information to the press?"" asked Trump Jr. ""Is this a joke?""""That was fun,"" Trump Jr. declared at the end of the hearing. He and his brother, Eric, now run their father's business in New York.Trump has a long history of responding to personal slights on Twitter, though his most volatile comments typically arrive in early morning and late-night hours, often when he is by himself and watching negative news coverage of his actions. Trump has been warned by lawyers to watch what he tweets because his comments could be used against him.Staff also kept the president busy, with a series of meetings and events.Trump spent Thursday morning meeting with his secretary of state, secretary of defense and national security adviser, discussing North Korea, the Persian Gulf region and other matters, said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. He then headed to the Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual conference, where he delivered a speech in front of a friendly crowd.Sanders tried to downplay the significance of the dramatic testimony,.""In terms of the mood in the White House, I would say that it's a regular Thursday at the White House. We're carrying on,"" she said.In his testimony, Comey accused the president of telling ""lies, plain and simple"" when he claimed that the FBI was in disarray and poorly led, and that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader.Comey also said he'd taken careful notes of his meetings because he worried the president might misrepresent them.Sanders objected to the characterization. ""I can definitively say the president's not a liar,"" she said."

Two of them Ghana and Pakistan have been included in the list this year.The other countries include Guyana in 2001, the Gambia in 2016, Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea, and Sierra Leone in 2017, Burma and Laos in 2018.Under Section 243 (d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Secretary of State is required to discontinue granting immigration or non-immigrant visas to a nation upon receiving notice from the Homeland Security Secretary that the country has denied or is unreasonably delaying accepting a citizen, subject, national or resident of that country.The State Department tried to downplay the impact of the sanctions on Pakistan.""Consular operations in Pakistan remain unchanged,” a State Department Spokesperson told PTI when asked about the federal register notification.“This is a bilateral issue of ongoing discussion between the US and Pakistani governments and we are not going to get into the specifics at this time,” the spokesperson added.Former Pakistan's Ambassador to the US, Hussain Haqqani, feels that this will make things difficult for Pakistanis.“This measure will create hardship for Pakistanis who want or need to travel to the US and could have been avoided if Pakistani authorities had not ignored American requests to respect their legal requirements for deportation,” Haqqani told PTI, days after the federal register notification.He said that Pakistan's refusal to accept it's citizen deported from the US is not new.“Pakistan’s refusal to accept every Pakistani citizen deported from the US is not new. It seems that the US is no longer willing to overlook a wide range of official Pakistani behaviour. Bonhomie has been replaced by sanctions and restrictions based on Islamabad’s policy decisions,” Haqqani said.While the law in this regard has been under existence since 1996, it is only in last several years that there had been increasing demand from lawmakers towards its enforcement against countries that had refused to accept deportees and visa over-stayers.In the last few years, India has been taking such deportees on special planes at regular intervals.The Trump administration after coming to power had said that it will strictly enforce such provisions by denying visas to people from those countries that refuse it accepting deportees and visa over-stayers.While section 243 (d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act was used only twice before 2017, the Trump Administration has been effective in using this provision on many countries, including Pakistan.However, the State Department federal register notification indicates that the number of visa denial under this sanction is far less.Since the law was modified to cover non-immigrant visas in 1996, 318 visa applicants have been affected, the notification said.“During this same time period, tens of millions of aliens have received non-immigrant visas including, collectively, millions of applicants from the 10 countries affected,” the notification said.The Federal Register notification said that there is no set formula, though, notably State has never issued a blanket refusal for visas from the country in question.“For some countries, sanctions begin by targeting officials who work in the ministries responsible for accepting the return of that country's nationals with escalation scenarios that target family members of those officials and potentially officials of other ministries and then other categories of applicants if initial sanctions do not prove effective at encouraging greater cooperation on removals by the targeted government,” the notification said."

He also admitted to exchanging phone numbers with the recruiter and having several conversations about extremism with him.Hassan further admitted he traveled to - and stayed with - JeM extremists for two or three days in 2014, traveled in Pakistan in 2013 and 2014 to collect money and food for JeM extremists, and passed out recruiting newspapers for JeM in Pakistan in 2014, the FBI said.Hassan admitted that he had not been truthful because he knew JeM was a terrorist group.""Between 2013 and 2014 I traveled... around the city of Gujrat (in Pakistan) and surrounding area collecting money and food for Jaish Mujahiden two or three times. In 2014, while staying with Jaish Mujahideen they told me about an attack on Indian soldier they conducted the previous year. They showed me a news video of the attack,"" Hassan said in a written statement to the FBI, according to court documents.""I also past out a newspaper that Jaish Mujahiden uses to recruit people and collect money. I lied because I was scared of getting in trouble because I participated in collecting money, food and passing out the newspaper for Jaish Mujahadin which is a terrorist group but they also help the poor in Pakistan,"" he said.Hassan was born on February 10, 1984 in Uttam Gujrat, Pakistan. He moved with his family to Brooklyn, New York in 1999 at the age of fifteen. He became a naturalised United States citizen in 2002 but retained citizenship in Pakistan.Hassan told investigators that he was in contact with ISIS as well.The complaint said because he was angry about what was happening to Muslims around the world, he was serious about sending USD 175 to Jihadists in Syria.Hassan said that he did not send the money because he did not have a way to get the money there. "

8513917eace800266c38054473cd3da8," President Donald Trump, left, and Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden, right, with moderator Chris Wallace, center, of Fox News during the first presidential debate Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2020, at Case Western University and Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)Marked by angry interruptions and bitter accusations, the first debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden erupted in contentious exchanges Tuesday night over the coronavirus pandemic, job losses and how the Supreme Court will shape the future of the nation’s health care.Fitting for an ugly campaign, the two men frequently talked over each other with Trump interrupting, nearly shouting, so often that Biden eventually snapped at him, “Will you shut up, man?”“The fact is that everything he’s said so far is simply a lie,” Biden said. “I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar.”Trump and Biden arrived in Cleveland hoping the debate would energize their bases of support, even as they competed for the slim slice of undecided voters who could decide the election. It has been generations since two men asked to lead a nation facing such tumult, with Americans both fearful and impatient about the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 of their fellow citizens and cost millions of jobs.The vitriol exploded into the open when Biden attacked Trump’s handling of the pandemic, saying that the president “waited and waited” to act when the virus reached America’s shores and “still doesn’t have a plan.” Biden told Trump to “get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap” and go in his golf cart to the Oval Office to come up with a bipartisan plan to save people. Trump snarled a response, declaring that “I’ll tell you Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don’t have it in your blood.”“I know how to do the job,” was the solemn response from Biden, who served eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president.The pandemic’s effects were in plain sight, with the candidates’ lecterns spaced far apart, all of the guests in the small crowd tested and the traditional opening handshake scrapped. The men did not shake hands and, while neither candidate wore a mask to take the stage, their families did sport face coverings.Trump struggled to define his ideas for replacing the Affordable Care Act on health care in the debate’s early moments and defended his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, declaring that “I was not elected for three years, I’m elected for four years.”“We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate. We have the White House and we have a phenomenal nominee, respected by all.”Trump criticized Biden over the former vice president’s refusal to comment on whether he would try to expand the Supreme Court in retaliation if Barrett is confirmed to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.With just 35 days until the election, and early voting already underway in some states, Biden stepped onto the stage holding leads in the polls — significant in national surveys, close in some battleground states — and looking to expand his support among suburban voters, women and seniors. Surveys show the president has lost significant ground among those groups since 2016, but Biden faces his own questions encouraged by Trump’s withering attacks.Trump had arguably his best chance to try to reframe the campaign as a choice between candidates and not a referendum over his handling of the virus that has killed more people in America than any other nation. Americans, according to polling, have soured on his leadership in the crisis, and the president has struggled to land consistent attacks on Biden.In the hours before the debate, Biden released his 2019 tax returns just days after the blockbuster revelations about Trump’s long-hidden tax history, including that he paid only $750 a year in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017 and nothing in many other years. The Bidens paid nearly $300,000 in taxes in 2019.Trump, in the debate, insisted that he paid millions in taxes — but refused to say how much he paid in federal income taxes — and insisted that he had taken advantage of legal tax incentives, another angry exchange that led to Biden declaring that Trump was the “worst president” the nation has ever had.Biden’s performances during the primary debates were uneven, and some Democrats have been nervous as to how he would fare in an unscripted setting. But his team also viewed the night as a chance to illuminate Trump’s failings with the pandemic and economy, with the former vice president acting as a “fact checker on the floor” while bracing himself for the onslaught that was coming.The tumult of 2020 was difficult to overstate: COVID-19 has rewritten the rules of everyday life; racial justice protests have swept into cities after several highly publicized killings of Black people by police, and the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg allowed Trump to nominate a conservative jurist to replace a liberal voice and perhaps reshape the high court for generations."

PM @narendramodi makes a special purchase, which he would offer as Prasad at the Shreenathji Temple in Bahrain tomorrow,"" the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) tweeted. Before the launch, an MoU to establish a technology interface between the payment platforms in India and UAE was exchanged between the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and UAE's Mercury Payments Services in the presence of the prime minister. As many as 21 major business groups -- including Lulu, Petrochem Middle East, NMC Healthcare and Landmark -- in the UAE have pledged to accept RuPay as a mode of payment.They stated that the initiative will go a long way in bringing India and the UAE businesses together.   The UAE receives about three million Indian tourists annually. Acceptance of Rupay card in UAE will lower the charges as tourists will save on exchange rate. The NPCI in association with the Mercury Payments Services, has made RuPay cards acceptable at 1,75,000 merchant locations and 5,000 ATM and cash access locations within the UAE.RuPay is a highly secure network that protects against cyberhacks and is India's version of Master Card and Visa.   Today, there are close to 500 million RuPay cards in circulation in India. RuPay has also tied-up with international players like Discover, Japan Credit Bureau and China Union Pay to enhance its international acceptance and recently achieved a milestone of issuing 25 million RuPay cards. ALSO READ | What is RuPay card?

Nikka Whisky Distilling's 'Taketsuru' branded drinks that have been aged for 17, 21 or 25 years will start disappearing from shelves after March, Japan's public broadcaster NHK said in a report on Tuesday.The company said that consumers in Japan and other countries places such as the UK and France have developed a taste for its premium whiskies, pressuring supply.The firm will spend about $60 million in the next two years to expand its production facilities in Hokkaido and Miyagi prefectures by around 20 per cent.Shipments of Japanese whiskies have doubled in the past decade.Two other brewers, Suntory and Kirin, have also stopped sales of some of their products as they failed to keep up with demand.They have been trying to boost their capacity to produce so-called base whiskies.Also Read: In wake of regional tensions, Iraq to purchase Russian S-300 defence system​  "

04e50419e19a3ef430565e60fb5cab1d,"FILEThe UK government on Wednesday announced an early access agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi Pasteur for an estimated 60 million doses of an experimental new vaccine being tested to combat COVID-19.The agreement with Britain's GSK and France's Sanofi, which combined have among the largest vaccine manufacturing capabilities in the world, will supply the UK with 60 million doses of their vaccine based on existing DNA-based technology used to produce Sanofi’s flu vaccine.While it remains uncertain as to which, if any, of the anti-coronavirus vaccines under various stages of development around the world will ultimately work, the British government said the latest deal helps grow the country’s portfolio of vaccine candidates and adds to previous agreements.""Our scientists and researchers are racing to find a safe and effective vaccine at a speed and scale never seen before. While this progress is truly remarkable, the fact remains that there are no guarantees,” said UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma.""In the meantime, it is important that we secure early access to a diverse range of promising vaccine candidates, like GSK and Sanofi, to increase our chances of finding one that works so we can protect the public and save lives,” he said.If the GSK and Sanofi vaccine candidate is proven effective in human studies, the UK could be able to vaccinate priority groups, such as frontline health and social care workers and those at increased health risk, as soon as summer 2021. Human clinical studies of the vaccine will begin in September followed by a Phase 3 study in December 2020.With the latest announcement, the government said it has now secured early access to four different types of immunisation and a total of 250 million doses, giving the UK the “most likely chance of finding a safe and effective vaccine at the quickest speed”.Kate Bingham, Chair of the government's Vaccines Taskforce, said: “This diversity of vaccine types is important because we do not yet know which, if any, of the different types of vaccine will prove to generate a safe and protective response to COVID-19. Whilst this agreement is very good news, we mustn’t be complacent or over optimistic.""The fact remains we may never get a vaccine and if we do get one, we have to be prepared that it may not be a vaccine which prevents getting the virus, but rather one that reduces symptoms.”Thomas Triomphe, Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sanofi Pasteur, said the company is collaborating with several countries and global organisations as part of ongoing efforts to ensure a “safe and effective vaccine” is available to everyone as quickly as possible.""We believe that this adjuvanted vaccine candidate has the potential to play a significant role in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic, both in the UK and around the world. We thank the UK government for confirmation of purchasing intent, which supports the significant investment we are already making as a company to scale up development and production of this vaccine,” added Roger Connor, President of GSK Vaccines.Earlier this month, the British government announced it had secured 90 million COVID-19 vaccine doses thanks to partnerships with the BioNTech / Pfizer alliance and Valneva.A deal has also been agreed to secure access to treatments containing COVID-19 neutralising antibodies from AstraZeneca, to protect those who cannot receive vaccines such as cancer and immunocompromised patients.This is in addition to an existing global licensing agreement signed with AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford to research, develop and manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine for the UK public. AstraZeneca will work to produce 100 million doses for the UK in total.The latest agreement comes as the government confirmed that almost 72,000 people have volunteered to receive information about participating in future vaccine studies following the launch of the NHS COVID-19 vaccine research registry last week. The aim is to get 500,000 people signed up by October to enable large-scale clinical studies. "

He was referring to the M5 highway, which links the capital Damascus with the northern city of Aleppo.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said government forces still have 30 kilometers (18 miles) of the highway to clear before it comes under full control of the army for the first time since 2012.Syrian state TV reported Saturday that government forces captured four villages in Aleppo province near the highway. It added that Syrian troops and demining experts have cleared explosives and mines from the recently captured town of Saraqeb that sits on an intersection where the M5 meets with the M4 highway, linking Syria's coast with the country's east.Syrian state media and the Observatory later reported that government forces captured the village of al-Eis and its strategic hill just east of the M5.The new push came as Turkey, a main backer of the opposition, sent more reinforcements into Idlib, according to the Observatory and Idlib-based media activist Taher al-Omar who is embedded with militants.The Observatory said a convoy consisting of 430 vehicles entered Syria since Friday night, raising the number of vehicles that entered Syria since last weekend to well over 1,000.A rare clash on Feb. 3, between Turkish troops and Syrian soldiers left seven Turkish soldiers and a Turkish civilian dead as well as 13 Syrian troops.On Friday, Turkey's Defense Ministry warned the army would respond “even more forcefully” to any attack on Turkish observation posts in the area, adding: “Our observation posts will continue carrying out duties.”The violence has also raised tensions between Russia and Turkey, which have been working together to secure cease-fires and political talks, despite backing opposite sides of the conflict.Also Read | Tehreek-e-Taliban militant escaped during anti-terror operation in Pakistan: Report "

Scientists, including those from McMaster University in Canada, said most virus transmission occurs via larger particles in secretions like droplets, generated while speaking, coughing, or sneezing, and some are created when water evaporates from these droplets, turning them into aerosol-sized particles.According to the review research, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, every virus-laden particle retained in a mask is not available to hang in the air as an aerosol, or fall to a surface to be later picked up by touch.Direct evidence about whether wearing a mask made of any material outside a health-care setting reduces transmission of COVID-19 is lacking, said study first author Catherine Clase from McMaster University.She explained that the point of wearing masks is not that some particles can penetrate, but that every virus-laden particle retained in a mask is not available to hang in the air or fall to a surface to be later picked up by another person.""Although no direct evidence indicates that cloth masks are effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the evidence that they reduce contamination of air and surfaces is convincing and should suffice to inform policy decisions on their use in this pandemic pending further research,"" the researchers noted.In the study, they examined a century of evidence including recent data, and found strong evidence showing that cloth masks can reduce contamination of air and surfaces.Based on the review research, Clase said cloth masks can block even aerosol-sized particles.She said a mask made of three layers (muslin-flannel-muslin) reduced surface contamination by 99 per cent, total airborne microorganisms by 99 percent, and bacteria recovered from aerosol-sized particles by 88 to 99 per cent.The study noted that a commercial mask which is made of four-layer cotton muslin can reduce all particles by 99 per cent, compared with 96 per cent to 99 per cent for contemporary disposable medical masks.Even for aerosols, Clase and her team believe that cloth masks are comparable with medical masks.While the filtration of cloth is variable with single layers of scarf, sweatshirt and t-shirt keeping away particles in the 10 to 40 per cent range, the scientists said multiple layers increase efficiency.Citing previous studies, the researchers said some combinations of cloth such as cotton-flannel, block more than 90 per cent of particles.In terms of making masks, it is important to realise that more layers will give more protection, both inward and outward, but will make it harder to breathe, Clase said, adding that children under two and people with breathing difficulties may not find these masks comfortable.She believes that more research is needed into the best materials and design of cloth masks, to help the many people who are sewing masks to protect people in their community.“Given the severity of this pandemic and the difficulty of control, we suggest that the possible benefit of a modest reduction in transmission likely outweighs the possibility of harm,” Clase said."

aa5e5339c58c0076eab9ea426f507b17,"WHO backed China for emergency use of COVID-19 experimental vaccines: Report The World Health Organisation (WHO) gave China its backing for “emergency use” of experimental coronavirus vaccines even though they have not yet completed clinical trials, a Chinese health official revealed on Friday. The vaccines still had to complete phase 3 of the clinical trials but the State Council approved the proposal on June 24.Zheng Zhongwei, head of medical science development at the National Health Commission, told reporters that the World Health Organisation gave its support to China for its emergency use of vaccines in late June, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.According to Zheng, the commission proposed the emergency use of the vaccines in mid-June to protect people in high-risk occupations such as frontline health workers, border officials and overseas workers.“After the approval, on June 29, we had a communication meeting with the relevant representatives of the WHO office in China, and obtained understanding and support from the WHO,” Post quoted Zheng as saying.He said that the approval strictly abided by China’s vaccine and pharmaceutical laws and used the WHO standards as a guide, adding that there were ""no severe adverse events"" from the injections.The WHO faced stringent criticism especially from US President Donald Trump who accused it of being a puppet of China for not acting in time to halt the spread of the COVID-19 when it broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year. Trump has also pulled the US out of the WHO.In his address to the UN General Assembly on September 23, Trump also attacked the WHO, saying it is “virtually controlled by China”.Last week, Yang Xiaoming, Chairman of China National Biotec Group, which had obtained approval to start the phase 3 trials for its coronavirus vaccine candidates in the UAE, said 350,000 people had been injected with the experimental vaccines under the scheme.Yang Sheng, Deputy director of the National Medical Products Administration's drug registration bureau, said that four China-developed COVID-19 vaccines have begun the final stage of human trials overseas after obtaining approval from the foreign authorities.China has been focusing on developing five types of vaccines and each method has at least one entering clinical trials. In total, 11 vaccine candidates are in different stages of testing, Yang was quoted as saying by state-run China Daily.Zheng said China’s annual capacity to make COVID-19 vaccines was expected to reach 610 million doses this year and 1 billion doses by 2021. He offered no details on how the doses would be distributed.Facing global adversity over the mass spread of the coronavirus, China plans to have diplomatic offensive, offering its vaccines specially to a number of smaller countries at affordable costs.China did not join the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (Covax) alliance to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.Zheng said China had been a supporter of Covax.Chinese representatives recently held a videoconference with the WHO, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations – which together founded Covax – on vaccine production and development.“We communicated in full detail about vaccine development, production and distribution. We will continue the close communication with these organisations to promote COVID-19 vaccines to become a global public good,” Zheng said.He said China would set an “affordable” price for vaccines for the public, with higher priority given to essential workers such as couriers and people handling frozen food, then people at high risk of COVID-19, including children, pregnant women and the elderly.(With inputs from agencies)"

Any contact with such groups is punishable under Russian law, but the Foreign Ministry has responded to questions about the apparent contradiction by saying its exchanges with the Taliban are essential for helping stabilize Afghanistan.Unlike many other countries, Russia hasn’t evacuated its embassy in Kabul and its ambassador has maintained regular contacts with the Taliban since they took over the Afghan capital of Kabul in August.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has in fact commended the Taliban for their efforts to stabilize the military-political situation in the country and ensure the operation of state structures.Russia has vowed to provide military assistance to its ex-Soviet allies in Central Asia to help counter the threats and held joint drills in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, which neighbor Afghanistan. Another sweeping military exercise in Tajikistan involving 5,000 troops, more than 700 military vehicles and combat jets has started this week.Taliban seized control of Kabul in August and they announced the interim government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in September.Taliban have been pushing for international recognition. However, the world community has made it clear that the Taliban have to deliver on the promises that they have made before any recognition. (With inputs from ANI and AP)Also Read | 17 killed in clash between Taliban, armed men in Afghanistan's Herat   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_9006559548 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/09/0_oakngccu/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_oakngccu_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Afghanistan faces food crisis under Taliban`s new government"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""161"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_9006559548 = ''; jwsetup_9006559548(); function jwsetup_9006559548() { jwvidplayer_9006559548 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_9006559548"").setup(jwconfig_9006559548); jwvidplayer_9006559548.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_9006559548, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_oakngccu\"", ns_st_pr=\""Afghanistan faces food crisis under Taliban`s new government\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Afghanistan faces food crisis under Taliban`s new government\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Afghanistan faces food crisis under Taliban`s new government\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-09-17\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-09-17\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/09/0_oakngccu/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_9006559548.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_9006559548.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_9006559548.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_9006559548.stop(); jwvidplayer_9006559548.remove(); jwvidplayer_9006559548 = ''; jwsetup_9006559548(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_9006559548.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_9006559548.stop(); jwvidplayer_9006559548.remove(); jwvidplayer_9006559548 = ''; jwsetup_9006559548(); return; }); jwvidplayer_9006559548.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9006559548.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9006559548.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9006559548.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9006559548.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9006559548.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

The plan would be accomplished as soon as the US Food and Drug Administration gives the necessary Emergency Use Authorisation to them.“With regard to the vaccine, we believe that there will be 40 million doses available by the end of the year. Again, this is extraordinary. This is the fastest vaccine in history by fivefold,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference.“It was only made possible because of this President, who said at the same time, ‘I am pursuing a vaccine; I am going to do something novel. I am going to manufacture it. So, many American lives will be saved thanks to President Trump and the great work of Operation Warp Speed,” she said.In recent days, Pfizer and Moderna reported the highly successful results of their coronavirus vaccine development, each achieving over 90 per cent effectiveness, she said.“We know Moderna is 94.5 per cent effective and Pfizer 95 per cent,” McEnany said.In July, the Trump administration as part of Operation Warp Speed had agreed to provide Pfizer with USD 1.95 billion to manufacture and distribute its COVID vaccine, and allowing the vaccine to be provided free for Americans.“While Democrats were pursuing a highly divisive and entirely baseless impeachment endeavour, as far back as January 13, this President, the Trump administration, and the National Institute of Health were partnering with Moderna and working on this vaccine for the American people,” McEnany said.“This administration has remained engaged on the development and distribution of a safe and effective vaccine throughout the year,” she added.The White House Press Secretary also said the administration has partnered with 64 jurisdictions in the country to make sure that each of these had individualised vaccine distribution plans.“Those have been assessed and made certain that they are good and operational,” she said, adding that the plan is available online.“There is also a distribution plan in place, which is why you heard General Perna say yesterday that within 24 hours of getting the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA), we will be able to distribute this all across the country,” she added."

We are proud to support the British Asian Trust as they develop their Development Impact Bond, which will provide access to quality education for hundreds of thousands of children,"" said DfID minister Priti Patel. The bond has been described as a step towards a greater focus on social impact financing as a transformational tool for philanthropy. The concept of Development Impact Bonds is intended as a result-oriented way to attract new capital into development, with a strong emphasis on data and evidence. Richard Hawkes, Chief Executive of the British Asian Trust, explains: ""At the heart of our programme strategy is a real determination to continue applying business principles to the work. We are convinced that only by applying these to philanthropy and to development are you really able to meet the needs of the greatest number of people."" Sir Ronald Cohen, international philanthropist and a champion of global impact investing, described the British Asian Trust's initiative as ""ground-breaking"" and capable of delivering vital social improvement at scale. In India, Prince Charles will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bilateral talks as part of a series of events planned during his two-day visit with wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall."

The driver was then shot by police after jumping out with what turned out to be two fake guns.A police official said the attack was being investigated as a possible act of terrorism. The official was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.The attacker was taken into custody. His condition was not immediately disclosed.Police said the vehicle, a rented Home Depot truck, entered the bike path on West Street a few blocks from the World Trade Center memorial and struck at least 15 people, leaving mangled bicycles behind. At least two bodies could be seen lying on the path beneath tarps.A man who was riding in an Uber along the West Side Highway near Chambers Street said he saw several bleeding people on the ground after the truck struck several people. Another witness said the truck had also collided with a small bus and one other vehicle.Tom Gay, a school photographer, was on Warren Street and heard people saying there was an accident. He went down to West Street and a woman came around the corner shouting, “He has a gun! He has a gun!”Gay said he stuck his head around the corner and saw a slender man in a blue track suit running southbound on West Street holding a gun. He said there was a heavyset man pursuing him.He said he heard five or six shots and the man in the tracksuit fell to the ground, gun still raised in the air. He said a man came over and kicked the gun out of his hand.Uber driver Chen Yi said he saw a truck plow into people on a popular bike path adjacent to the West Side Highway. He said he then heard seven to eight shots and then police pointing a gun at a man kneeling on the pavement.“I saw a lot of blood over there. A lot of people on the ground,” Yi said.His passenger, Dmitry Metlitsky, said he also saw police standing near a man who was on his knees with his hands up, and another man bleeding on the ground nearby. He said the truck had also collided with a small school bus and one other vehicle.The White House says President Donald Trump has been briefed on the vehicle that drove onto a bike path near the World Trade Center and struck several people.White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders says the president and New York native has been briefed by White House chief of staff John Kelly and “will be continually updated as more details are known.”Sanders says, “Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected.”(With AP inputs)"

b17077f53ce00d4dce18bf94fa3c1d66,"Medical Assistant Keona Shepard holds up the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine as she prepares to administer it at the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention CenterFully vaccinated Americans can gather with other vaccinated people indoors without wearing a mask or social distancing, according to long-awaited guidance from federal health officials. The recommendations also say that vaccinated people can come together in the same way — in a single household — with people considered at low-risk for severe diseases, such as in the case of vaccinated grandparents visiting healthy children and grandchildren.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the guidance Monday.The guidance is designed to address growing demand, as more adults have been getting vaccinated and wondering if it gives them greater freedom to visit family members, travel, or do other things like they did before the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world last year.“With more and more people vaccinated each day, we are starting to turn a corner,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.During a press briefing Monday, she called the guidance a “first step” toward restoring normalcy in how people come together. She said more activities would be ok’d for vaccinated individuals once caseloads and deaths decline, more Americans are vaccinated, and as more science emerges on the ability of those who have been vaccinated to get and spread the virus.The CDC is continuing to recommend that fully vaccinated people still wear well-fitted masks, avoid large gatherings, and physically distance themselves from others when out in public. The CDC also advised vaccinated people to get tested if they develop symptoms that could be related to COVID-19.The CDC guidance did not speak to people who may have gained some level of immunity from being infected, and recovering from, the coronavirus.Officials say a person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the last required dose of vaccine. About 31 million Americans — or only about 9% of the U.S. population — have been fully vaccinated with a federally authorized COVID-19 vaccine so far, according to the CDC.Authorized vaccine doses first became available in December, and they were products that required two doses spaced weeks apart. But since January, a small but growing number of Americans have been fully vaccinated, and have been asking questions like: Do I still have to wear a mask? Can I go to a bar now? Can I finally see my grandchildren?The guidance was “welcome news to a nation that is understandably tired of the pandemic and longs to safely resume normal activities,” said Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting director of the CDC.“I hope that this new guidance provides the momentum for everyone to get vaccinated when they can and gives states the patience to follow the public health roadmap needed to reopen their economies and communities safely,” said Besser, in a statement.But some said the guidance is too cautious.Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the University of Nebraska College of Public Health, said the guidance is reasonable in many respects — with the exception of travel.The CDC did not change its recommendations on travel, which discourages unnecessary travel and calls for getting tested within a few days of the trip. That could seem confusing to vaccinated people hoping to visit family across the country or abroad.“They need to relax travel for those vaccinated” and to immediately publish electronic standards for documents that show whether a person is fully vaccinated, said Khan, who formerly was a leading CDC disease detective.The new guidance also says nothing about going to restaurants or other places, even though governors are lifting restrictions on businesses, said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who formerly was Baltimore’s health commissioner.Wen has said the CDC should have had some kind of post-vaccination guidance ready in January when some people first began to finish their second doses. And she called the guidance that came out Monday “far too cautious.”“The CDC is missing a major opportunity to tie vaccination status with reopening guidance. By coming out with such limited guidance, they are missing the window to influence state and national policy,” Wen said, in an email.But some people who are fully vaccinated were pleased by Monday’s news.Ruth Michienzi was among those receiving her second and final vaccine dose at a pharmacy inside a Stop and Shop supermarket in Woburn, Massachusetts on Monday morning.The 91-year-old resident of nearby Burlington said she’s fine with having to still wear a facemask in public and follow other safety guidelines even after being fully vaccinated.But Michienzi also said she’s excited to finally be able to take off her mask in front of her three great-grandchildren. She’s seen them in person since receiving her first shot about a month ago but has kept her mask on.“I hope they remember me,” she said.“I’ve been doing all of that for a year, and I don’t want that year to be wasted,” Michienzi said of the safety regulations. “I think it’s smart to wait.”A pair of customers, who weren’t in line to receive shots, though, openly groused about the continued restrictions and voiced fears that stricter mandates on travel and socializing would follow, even as more are vaccinated.Grace McShane, 61, of Melrose, also received her second dose Monday at the same supermarket.She says she qualified for the vaccine because she’s a high risk, including suffering a heart attack last year. The in-home caregiver said she too was fine with the continued restrictions even after being vaccinated.“Even if you’re vaccinated, it’s better to be safe than sorry. This is the new normal. This is part of life and you just have to adapt to it,” McShane said.She said she’s looking forward to hugging her three grandchildren without having to wear a mask. Her grown children have also been vaccinated as essential workers, she said.“Just cuddle and give them hugs,” McShane said. “That’s all I want to do.”   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_6384676082 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/01/0_w619hjle/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_w619hjle_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""All myths and rumors on coronavirus vaccine decoded "", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""457"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_6384676082 = ''; jwsetup_6384676082(); function jwsetup_6384676082() { jwvidplayer_6384676082 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_6384676082"").setup(jwconfig_6384676082); jwvidplayer_6384676082.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_6384676082, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_w619hjle\"", ns_st_pr=\""All myths and rumors on coronavirus vaccine decoded\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""All myths and rumors on coronavirus vaccine decoded\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""All myths and rumors on coronavirus vaccine decoded\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-01-29\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-01-29\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/01/0_w619hjle/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_6384676082.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_6384676082.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_6384676082.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_6384676082.stop(); jwvidplayer_6384676082.remove(); jwvidplayer_6384676082 = ''; jwsetup_6384676082(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_6384676082.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_6384676082.stop(); jwvidplayer_6384676082.remove(); jwvidplayer_6384676082 = ''; jwsetup_6384676082(); return; }); jwvidplayer_6384676082.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6384676082.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6384676082.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6384676082.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6384676082.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6384676082.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "
f0a5c427fcfabf61266e8e824203eb56,"A Ukrainian soldier stands next to a military vehicle on a road in Kramatosrk, eastern Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022.Russia-Ukraine war: The European Union is planning the “strongest, the harshest package” of sanctions it has ever considered at an emergency summit Thursday as the Russian military attacked Ukraine.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that “the target is the stability in Europe and the whole of the international peace order, and we will hold President (Vladimir) Putin accountable for that”.“We will present a package of massive and targeted sanctions to European leaders for approval,” she said.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called it the “strongest, the harshest package” ever considered.“A major nuclear power has attacked a neighbor country and is threatening reprisals of any other states that may come to the rescue,” Borrell said. “This is not only the greatest violation of international law, it's a violation of the basic principles of human co-existence. It's costing many lives with unknown consequences ahead of us. The European Union will respond in the strongest possible terms.”Von der Leyen said the “massive and targeted sanctions” she will put to EU leaders “will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking the access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia”.She said the sanctions, if approved, “will weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernize. And in addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial financial markets.”Like the first package of sanctions that were imposed when Russia recognised the two breakaway eastern Ukrainian republics, von der Leyen said all Western powers were walking in lockstep.“We are closely aligned with our partners and allies the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, but also, for example, Japan and Australia,” she said.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Western allies won't stand by as Russia attacks Ukraine.In an early morning call, Johnson told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he was appalled by events in Ukraine, according to a statement released by the prime minister's office.“The Prime Minister said the West would not stand by as President Putin waged his campaign against the Ukrainian people,” Johnson's office said in the statement. Johnson added that Ukraine was in the thoughts of everyone in the UK “during this dark time”.The turmoil from the beginning of a long-feared act of aggression rippled from Europe to Asia. Stock markets plunged, oil prices surged, and European aviation officials warned of a high risk to civilian aircraft over Ukraine, reminding air operators that “this is now an active conflict zone”.In New York, the UN Security Council held an extraordinary emergency meeting meant to dissuade Russia from sending troops into Ukraine. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' plea to “give peace a chance” came just as Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared on Russian TV to announce a military operation that he maintained was to protect civilians in Ukraine.Putin, who said that rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military assistance, warned other countries that any effort to interfere with the Russian operation would lead to “consequences they have never seen”.As leaders across Asia and Europe scrambled to condemn the attack, explosions were heard in Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine. Nations around the world this week have also imposed a raft of new sanctions on Russia.Moscow had massed more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine's borders. On Monday, Putin recognized the independence of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and ordered Russian forces there for what he called “peacekeeping”.Guterres at the UN disputed that, saying the troops were entering another country without its consent.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Russia's attack “a terrible day for Ukraine and a dark day for Europe” and “a blatant violation of international law. It cannot be justified by anything”.In a bulletin Thursday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said “there is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft” and that “the presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems poses a HIGH risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels”. Asian stock markets were in turmoil.Market benchmarks in Tokyo and Seoul fell 2% and Hong Kong and Sydney lost more than 3% Thursday. Oil prices jumped nearly $3 per barrel on unease about possible disruption of Russian supplies. Earlier, Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% to an eight-month low.Russia seized Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula in 2014, and pro-Russia rebels have since been fighting Ukrainian forces in the eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict.Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala condemned the Russian attack as “absolutely unjustified act of aggression against a sovereign state”. Slovakia Prime Minister Eduard Heger called it “an unjustified barbarian act.”Many world capitals were trying to determine just what was happening in the tense and fast-changing early moments of a chaotic and violent event.“We are putting all our effort into collecting the information and comprehending the situation,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said shortly after Putin's announcement. “It's important and challenging to secure the safety of Japanese people (in Ukraine). After fully comprehending the situation, we will handle the case properly.”Asked whether Taiwan would cooperate with the US and like-minded countries to put export controls on semi-conductors and technology products that the self-ruled island is known for, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Joanne Ou said “they were in close coordination” and would take the “appropriate actions in response to help Ukraine and uphold the area's peace and stability”.China, which has denounced sanctions against Russia, advised its citizens in Ukraine to stay home and place a Chinese flag in or on their vehicles if they need to travel long distances.“Social order is chaotic and out of control, especially in the cities where at times of serious unrest, walking on the streets could make one a target of attack, traffic could be stopped at any time and venturing out creates the possibility of running into uncontrollable risks,” the notice said.China has increasingly aligned its foreign policy with Russia to challenge the West, and has blamed the United States and its allies for provoking Moscow.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said sanctions against Russia would become law Friday but would not take effect until the end of March. He said the time was needed to give “opportunities for businesses that have had very legitimate operations and business interests in Russia and in the affected territories of Ukraine to be able to make changes to their arrangements”.Morrison said financial sanctions and travel bans that target eight members of the Russian Security Council will be a first batch of measures in response to Russian aggression toward Ukraine. Australia will also align with the US and Britain by targeting two Russian banks.“The reason we're doing this is there must be a price for the unprovoked, unlawful, unwarranted, unjustified attacks and threats and intimidation that has been imposed by Russia on Ukraine. This cannot be a consequence-free action by Vladimir Putin and the Russian regime,” Morrison said. ALSO READ: Russia Ukraine War: EXCLUSIVE video shows panic stricken Kharkiv civilians queue up outside mart"

Nations should restore the longstanding standard of no enrichment for Iran's nuclear program. Iran's regime, armed with nuclear weapons, would pose an even greater danger to the world,"" Pompeo said on Sunday in a message posted on Twitter, Efe news reported.Related Stories Stabbing at US plasma donation centre, suspect heldUS President Donald Trump vows to pursue citizenship census question Iran to raise uranium enrichment beyond limits. What it meansOn Sunday, Iran said it would raise its uranium enrichment level beyond the 3.67 per cent level, marking the second violation of the nuclear deal, but Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the move could be reversed if European countries upheld their commitments.The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) limited Iranian nuclear activity in exchange for relief from sanctions.Tensions with Iran have been rising since the United States pulled out of the nuclear deal with Tehran last year and escalated after President Donald Trump ended sanctions exemptions for purchases of Iranian oil in April.Trump withdrew the US from the JCPOA in 2018 and Iran's supreme leader has said he was not interested in negotiations until and unless Washington returns to the 2015 pact and ends sanctions that are harming the Iranian economy.Iran and the rest of the signatories - Russia, China, France, Germany, the UK and the European Union - officially remain committed to the JCPOA.""Today, Iran is taking its second round of remedial steps under Para 36 of the JCPOA,"" the Iranian foreign minister said. ""We reserve the right to continue to exercise legal remedies within JCPOA to protect our interests in the face of US #EconomicTerrorism.""Trump has been a harsh critic of the JCPOA, calling it a bad deal made by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and former Secretary of State John Kerry.Last Monday, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that Iran had exceeded the limits on its stockpile of uranium, which can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors or to make atomic bombs.The IAEA, a UN agency, said its inspectors verified that Iran's stockpile of UF6 was larger than allowed.Also Read | US-led airstrike kills 3 IS militants in Iraqwatch | US President Donald Trump approved strikes on Iran but pulled back   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

83200809bb030e1aedf836b37cb47d01,"Representative imageThe Taliban said Sunday they have agreed to a temporary cease-fire nationwide. It provides a window during which a peace agreement with the United States could be signed. A peace deal would allow Washington to bring home its troops from Afghanistan and end its 18-year military engagement there, America's longest. The U.S. wants any deal to include a promise from the Taliban that Afghanistan would not be used as a base by terrorist groups. The U.S. currently has an estimated 12,000 troops in Afghanistan.The Taliban chief must approve the agreement but that is expected. The duration of the cease-fire was not specified but it is being suggested it would last for 10 days.our members of the Taliban negotiating team met for a week with the ruling council before they agreed on the brief cease fire. The negotiating team returned on Sunday to Qatar where they maintain their political office.The Taliban officials familiar with the negotiations spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.A key pillar of the agreement, which the U.S. and Taliban have been hammering out for more than a year, is direct negotiations between Afghans on both sides of the conflict.Those intra-Afghan negotiations are expected to be held within two weeks of the signing of a U.S.-Taliban peace deal. They will likely decide what a post-war Afghanistan will look like, and what role the Taliban will play. The negotiations would cover a wide range of subjects, such as the rights of women, free speech and the fate of the the tens of thousands of Taliban fighters, as well as the heavily armed militias belonging to Afghanistan's warlords who have amassed wealth and power since the Taliban's ouster.The temporary cease-fire had been proposed by U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad during the last round of talks.Also Read | President Donald Trump retweets post naming alleged whistleblowerWatch | Indian army retalites to Pak firing, destroyes army bunkers at Leepa Valley in PoK   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

12fbfac783dee59a0a5f1791363f91db,"James Comey has said that Clinton email inquiry mishandled. Former FBI director James Comey did not follow protocol in his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and improperly shared information about the probe with the public, a review of the agency's actions during the 2016 US presidential campaign has concluded. But the report by the Justice Department's internal watchdog found no evidence to support President Donald Trump's claim that the agency was motivated by political animus as it investigates potential collusion between his campaign and Russia. Related Stories Donald Trump dares Hillary Clinton to run in 2020 presidential polls Clinton camp helped fund Trump dossier research: SourceDonald Trump says Hillary Clinton's team funding for 'fake' Russia dossier ‘a disgrace’Hillary Clinton in India: Former US Secretary of State fractures wrist after fall in JodhpurThe FBI's probe stemmed from Clinton's use of a persona email server while she was the secretary of state. The investigation focused on whether Clinton sent or received classified information through a server in the basement of her New York home, which was not authorized to handle such messages. ""We concluded that Comey's unilateral announcement was inconsistent with the department policy and violated long-standing Department practice and protocol by, among other things, criticising Clinton's uncharged conduct,"" the report said. ""We also found that Comey usurped the authority of the attorney general, and inadequately and incompletely described the legal position of department prosecutors,"" it added. The over 500-page report issued yesterday by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, said it had discovered text and instant messages between some FBI employees that expressed statements of hostility towards the then candidate Trump and that of support for Clinton. ""We also identified messages that expressed opinions that were critical of the conduct and quality of the investigation,"" said the report, which the White House said vindicates the consistent stand of Trump in this regard. The report largely focuses on the conduct of the nation's top law enforcement agency, which is historically non-partisan, during the 2016 presidential election. Inspector General Michael Horowitz said Comey had broken ""dramatically from FBI and department norms"" in handling an inquiry into Clinton's emails.  Clinton, 70, has blamed Comey for her election loss to Trump in 2016. The report by the Justice Department also said Comey used a private email account to conduct official FBI business. FBI director Christopher Wray said he accepted the report's findings, but he added that nothing in the report pointed towards political bias or impugned the FBI as an institution. The inspector general criticised Comey's decision to reveal publicly a week before the election that he had reopened the inquiry into Clinton's emails, rejecting his argument that he had acted in the interests of transparency. He found that while Comey's actions were not the result of political bias, ""by departing so clearly and dramatically from the FBI and department norms, the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice"". The report also found ""a troubling lack of any direct, substantive communication"" between Comey and Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. In a statement, Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said the report made clear that Comey and FBI personnel failed to follow the rules, and in doing so, hurt Clinton's campaign and helped Trump's. ""In a frenzy of tweets since taking office, the President has claimed a vast conspiracy in his own government against his campaign and administration, but this report found no evidence that political bias affected the FBI investigations,"" he said. In the report, a paragraph summarising the factors that led the FBI to assess that it was possible that hostile actors accessed Clinton's server was added, and at one point referenced Clinton's use of her private email for an exchange with then President Obama while in the territory of a foreign adversary. This reference later was changed to ""another senior government official,"" and ultimately was omitted, it said. Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said the report from the Department of Justice's Inspector General shed new light on the cumulative bias at some of the highest levels of the FBI during the lead-up to the 2016 election. "

So, despite whatever has happened on that side (Afghanistan), the situation on the Pak-Afghan border is normal and under control,"" army spokesman Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar told reporters.""This does not mean nothing can happen but we are prepared and won't be caught unaware,"" he added.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan on August 15, two weeks before the US was set to complete its troop withdrawal after a costly two-decade war. The insurgents stormed across the country, capturing all major cities in a matter of days, as Afghan security forces trained and equipped by the US and its allies melted away.""Seventeen out of 78 border crossings were notified (for enhanced deployment) and all illegal crossings were closed.

cfe24d1d1d1dc8ffd93210cc3608483a,"Video: Dallas Judge hugs slain man's brother in a never seen courtroom actA white Dallas police officer who said she mistook a neighbour’s apartment for her own and fatally shot him in his living room was sentenced Wednesday to a decade in prison in a stunning courtroom scene that included the dead man’s brother and the black judge embracing the sobbing officer.People outside of the courtroom reacted angrily to the sentence given to Amber Guyger in the death of Botham Jean, believing it was too lenient. But Jean’s brother addressed her directly from the witness stand.Brandt Jean told Guyger that his brother would have wanted her to turn her life over to Christ, and that if she asks God for forgiveness, she will get it.“I love you as a person. I don’t wish anything bad on you,” he said to the 31-year-old Guyger, before asking the judge, “I don’t know if this is possible, but can I give her a hug?”The judge said he could, and Brandt and Guyger stood up, met in front of the bench and embraced while Guyger cried. Judge Tammy Kemp also hugged Guyger before she was led from the courtroom.The shooting in September 2018 drew widespread attention because of the strange circumstances and because it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers.Jurors could have sentenced the former officer to up to life in prison or as little as two years, but prosecutors asked them to send her to prison for 28 years, which is how old Botham Jean would have been if he were still alive.She will be eligible for parole in five years, after serving half of her sentence.As video of the dramatic hearing circulated online, critics blasted the judge, saying her hug was inappropriate for the jurist overseeing the case. Meanwhile at a Dallas church where the Jean family gathered to worship and Botham Jean had led the congregation singing, video of Brandt Jean embracing Guyger in court drew applause and “amens” when showed Wednesday night.Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, a former trial judge, called Brandt Jean’s embrace of Guyger “an amazing act of healing and forgiveness that is rare in today’s society ... especially for many of our leaders.”If Jean’s 18-year-old brother “can heal and express healing in that fashion, in his words and in his deeds, I would hope that the greater community, not just Dallas but all of Texas and all of the United States, could gain a message from that,” he told reporters.Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson issued a statement saying he would “never, ever forget the incredible examples of love, faith and strength personified by Botham, Brandt and the entire Jean family.”Guyger’s attorney asked jurors to show mercy, pointing to the good she did for people, including some who spoke at the hearing.Among them was officer Cathy Odhiambo, who described Guyger as a longtime friend who dreamed of being a police officer when they waited tables at a TGI Fridays. She said the two of them went through the academy and them came through the police ranks together.“Everybody that knows her knows that Amber is the sweetest person,” Odhiambo said.Odhiambo, who is black, was not asked about text messages that prosecutors said indicated a lack of sensitivity by Guyger toward black people. However, another fellow officer, Thomas MacPherson, said some of those texts sounded “out of character” for Guyger, whom he described as “someone you could depend on.”When a sniper opened fire on police during a rally in downtown Dallas three years ago, killing five of them, Guyger was “so brave,” MacPherson said. He said the two of them ran toward the gunfire and helped panicked citizens along the way.LaWanda Clark, who is black, said she met Guyger when the former officer busted a drug house, and that it helped change her life. She was struggling with a crack cocaine addiction. Guyger, while ticketing her, told her it could be the catalyst for turning around her life. She said Guyger treated her as a person, not an addict, and that she’s now sober.As Clark spoke, Guyger’s lawyers showed jurors a photo of Guyger attending Clark’s graduation from a community drug treatment program.Jean’s father told jurors about how his son’s death upended his life back in St. Lucia.Bertrum Jean said that after his son left their Caribbean island for college in Arkansas, he would call home every Sunday after church to catch up with the tightly knit family. Now, he said, his Sundays “have been destroyed.”“How could we have lost Botham? Such a sweet boy. He tried his best to live a good honest life. He loved God. He loved everyone. How could this happen to him?” the father said, breaking into tears.Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Jean’s mother, Allison Jean, criticized the investigation into her son’s death and the police training to shoot to kill.If Guyger “was trained not to shoot in the heart, my son would be alive today. He was no threat to her. He had no reason to be a threat to her, because he was in his own apartment,” Allison Jean said.The basic facts of the shooting were not in dispute. Guyger, returning from a long shift that night, parked on the wrong floor and mistook Jean’s apartment for her own, which was directly below his. Finding the door ajar, she entered and shot him, thinking he was a burglar. He had been eating a bowl of ice cream before she fired.In the frantic 911 call played repeatedly during the trial, Guyger said “I thought it was my apartment” nearly 20 times. Her lawyers argued that the identical physical appearance of the apartment complex from floor to floor frequently led to tenants going to the wrong apartments.But prosecutors questioned how Guyger could have missed numerous signs that she was in the wrong place. They also asked why she did not call for backup and suggested she was distracted by sexually explicit phone messages she had been exchanging with her police partner, who was also her lover.The jury was largely made up of women and people of colour."
95acba6133a41716f641c857a587e61d,"FILEIn a sign of the growing political prominence of Hindus in America, the Trump and Biden campaigns are wooing this small religious minority community like never before.Hinduism is the fourth largest faith in the US, representing approximately one per cent of the US population in 2016.While the Trump campaign promises that re-electing President Donald Trump will “reduce obstacles to religious freedoms” for Hindus in America, the rival Biden campaign on Tuesday said former vice president Joe Biden has made outreach to the Hindu faith community a priority.For the first time in an American presidential election, the Trump Campaign on August 14 announced the formation of the “Hindu Voices for Trump. ” Two days later, prominent Hindu leader Neelima Gonuguntla participated in an interfaith service to kick off the Democratic National Convention, which the Biden campaign said was another sign of the growing political prominence of Hindus in America.The details of the new coalition of the Trump Campaign to woo the Hindu-American community in the US is expected to be announced during the Republican National Convention next week.“Hindus for Trump honours contributions by millions of Americans of Hindu faith,” said the campaign which has taken a lead ahead of the Biden campaign.“The inclusive economy, commitment to building up US-Indian relations, and fierce support for religious liberties for all is unmatched. Re-electing President Trump will reduce obstacles to religious freedoms for Hindus in America,” asserted the Trump campaign.Biden, who on Tuesday was officially nominated as the Democratic presidential nominee, “has made outreach to the Hindu faith community a priority,” South Asians for Biden, a political platform, said.Over the weekend, the Biden campaign released the platform for Indian-Americans, which addresses several key concerns of the Hindu community.Notably, Biden proposes stiffening penalties for hate crimes committed at houses of worship, such as temples, and increasing the security grants available to such houses of worship. He has also pledged to make the prosecution of hate crimes a priority for his Department of Justice, the campaign said.“Increased access to the security grants and prioritising the prosecution of hate crimes is critical for our Hindu community,” said Niki Shah, a Hindu community organiser who worked closely on Hindu initiatives for former president Barack Obama’s faith-based council.“It was important to have a representative from the Hindu community because we wanted this interfaith service to reflect our nation’s religious diversity,” said Josh Dickson, National Faith Engagement Director at Biden for President, explaining inviting Gonuguntla to participate in the interfaith service.Gonuguntla, who serves as a board member of the Chinmaya Mission Dallas Fort Worth, shared verses from sacred Hindu texts, including the Vedas and the Mahabharata.“The participation of a Hindu-American took on added significance, given that Senator Kamala Harris, who is Vice President Biden’s running mate, grew up in a household that was both Hindu and Christian,” South Asians for Biden said.Biden has shown key insight into the issues affecting the Hindu community, it said.For example, he recently promised to streamline the processing of religious worker visas, which are relied upon by Hindu swamis and other religious scholars who visit the United States for religious events.

""As we scale up delivery of Covid-19 vaccines, we have to ensure that this does not come at the cost of essential childhood vaccinations ...The time to catch up is now.""The good news is that countries have been working to mitigate disruptions, says the survey. More than half of the countries surveyed say they have recruited additional staff to boost their health workforce; redirected patients to other care facilities; and switched to alternative methods of delivering care.""It is encouraging to see that countries are beginning to build back their essential health services, but much remains to be done,"" said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.""The survey highlights the need to intensify efforts and take additional steps to close gaps and strengthen services. It will be especially important to monitor the situation in countries that were struggling to provide health services before the pandemic."" "
32ccc961db28224a0ffcdb9d462d2a86,"Mahinda RajapaksaMahinda Rajapaksa will resign on Saturday, the disputed Sri Lankan prime minister's son announced on Friday. The announcement signalled an end to the nearly two-month power tussle in the island nation after two crucial Supreme Court decisions made the embattled former strongman's efforts to cling to premiership untenable. Related Stories Sri Lanka political crisis: Mahinda Rajapaksa calls for snap pollsSri Lanka political crisis: Setback for Sirisena as Mahinda Rajapaksa barred from acting as Prime MinisterSri Lanka court postpones hearing on petition against Rajapkas'a authorityEarlier in the day, the apex court refused to stay a court order restraining Rajapaksa, 73, from holding the office of Prime Minister until it fully heard the case next month. Rajapaksa was appointed as the prime minister on October 26 by President Maithripala Sirisena in a controversial move after sacking Ranil Wickremesinghe, which plunged the country into an unprecedented constitutional crisis. ""To ensure stability of the nation, Former President @PresRajapaksa has decided to resign from the Premiership tomorrow after an address to the nation,"" Rajapaksa's son Namal tweeted. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) with former president, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and others will ""now work to form a broader political coalition with President Sirisena"", Namal Rajapaksa, a lawmaker, added.Wickremesinghe's camp was hopeful that Sirisena would now reinstate him over the weekend after Rajapaksa resigns, effectively ending the political stalemate that plagued the nation for the past seven weeks.On Thursday, Wickremesinghe, 69, tweeted, ""We trust that the President will promptly respect the judgment of the courts. The legislature, judiciary, and the executive are equally important pillars of a democracy and the checks and balances that they provide are crucial to ensuring the sovereignty of its citizens.""There was no immediate reaction from President Sirisena, the architect of the current crisis.Parliamentarian Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said Rajapaksa, who ruled Sri Lanka for nearly a decade, decided to step down in the best interest of the country.He claimed Rajapaksa can hold office without resigning but that will only further drag the political turmoil in the country. So the former president decided to step down after the court ruling given on Friday and on Thursday. His Cabinet will also stand dissolved, Abeywardena was quoted as saying by the Colombo Gazette.The apex court's Friday ruling came a day after it unanimously declared that the dissolution of Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena was ""illegal"", in a body blow to the embattled leader, whose controversial decisions plunged the island nation into an unprecedented political turmoil.The Supreme Court decided that a Court of Appeal order issued against the appointment of Rajapaksa as Prime Minister and against his Cabinet from holding office will stand.The appeal filed by Rajapaksa will be taken up for hearing on January 16, 17 and 18.The apex court asked all parties to provide written submissions within three weeks. The Appeal Court on December 3 issued notice and an interim order against Rajapaksa and his Government, preventing them from acting as Prime Minister, Cabinet and Deputy Ministers.The order was issued in a case filed by 122 lawmakers against Rajapaksa and his new government.Rajapaksa and the members of the purported government filed the appeal against the Court of Appeal's interim injunction that restrained them from functioning in their respective posts.The United National Front (UNF) said the order means Rajapaksa cannot be Prime Minister and so the former Cabinet must be reinstated.UNF Parliamentarian Ajith Perera said the President must now appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister.Parliamentarians of Wickremesinghe's UNP, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and Tamil National Alliance on November 23 filed the petition in the Court of Appeal challenging Rajapaksa on continuing to hold the office of Prime Minister after a no-confidence motion was passed in Parliament against him.Sirisena, after sacking Wickremesinghe, dissolved Parliament and called for a snap election on January 5.However, the Supreme Court overturned his decision and halted the preparations for snap polls.Wickremesinghe and Rajapaksa both claim to be the prime ministers with the former claiming that his dismissal is invalid because he still holds a majority in the 225-member Parliament.Prior to the crisis, Wickramasinghe's UNP had the backing of 106 parliamentarians while Rajapaksa and Sirisena combine had 95 seats.Rajapaksa has, so far, failed to prove his majority in Parliament.The President has said that due to sharp personal differences with Wickremesinghe, he would not reappoint him as the Prime Minister.However, Wickremesinghe's UNP claims that Sirisena will be left with no choice as he would be the man who will command the confidence in the House. Most of the countries have not recognised Rajapaksa's government. The global credit rating agencies -- the Fitch, the Standard & Poor's and the Moody's -- had also downgraded Sri Lanka's rating owing to the current political crisis.( With inputs from PTI ) "

ec863fecb2a67f09e5c73ff669135ed4,"Ukraine hit by more cyberattacks, destructive malwareUkraine’s parliament and other government and banking websites were hit with another wave of distributed-denial-of-service attacks Wednesday, and cybersecurity researchers said unidentified attackers had also infected hundreds of computers with destructive malware.Officials have long said they expect cyber attacks to precede and accompany any Russian military incursion, and analysts said the incidents hew to a nearly two-decade-old Russian playbook of wedding cyber operations with real-world aggression.ESET Research Labs said it detected a new data-wiping piece of malware in Ukraine Wednesday on “hundreds of machines in the country.” It was not clear, however, how many networks were affected.“With regards whether the malware was successful in its wiping capability, we assume that this indeed was the case and affected machines were wiped,” ESET research chief Jean-Ian Boutin said in response to questions from The Associated Press.Boutin would not name the targets “to protect the victims, but these were large organizations that have been affected,” he said, adding that while ESET is unable to say who was responsible, “the attack appears to be related to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.”Vikram Thakur, technical director at Symantec Threat Intelligence, said his outfit detected three organizations hit by the wiper malware — Ukrainian government contractors in Latvia and Lithuania and a financial institution in Ukraine.All three had “close affiliation with the government of Ukraine,” said Thakur, indicating the attacks were anything but randomly targeted. He said roughly 50 computers at the financial organization were impacted by the malware, some with data wiped.“No comments,"" senior Ukrainian cyber defense official Victor Zhora said when asked about the ESET finding. Boutin said the malware’s timestamp indicates it was created in late December. He said it has only been seen in Ukraine.“Russia likely has been planning this for months, so it is hard to say how many organizations or agencies have been backdoored in preparation for these attacks,” said Chester Wisniewski, principal research scientist at the cybersecurity firm Sophos. He guessed the Kremlin intended with the malware to “send the message that they have compromised a significant amount of Ukrainian infrastructure and these are just little morsels to show how ubiquitous their penetration is.”Word of the wiper follows a mid-January attack that Ukrainian officials blamed on Russia in which the defacement of some 70 government websites was used to mask intrusions into government networks in which at least two servers were damaged with wiper malware masquerading as ransomware.Thakur said it was too early to say if the malware attack discovered Wednesday was as serious as the variety that damaged servers in January. Cyberattacks have been a key tool of Russian aggression in Ukraine since before 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Crimea and hackers tried to thwart elections. They were also used against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.Distributed-denial-of-service attacks are among the least impactful because they don’t entail network intrusion. Such attacks barrage websites with junk traffic so they become unreachable.The DDoS targets Wednesday included the defense and foreign ministries, the Council of Ministers and Privatbank, the country’s largest commercial bank. Many of the same sites were similarly knocked offline Feb. 13-14 in DDoS attacks that the U.S. and U.K. governments quickly blamed on Russia’s GRU military intelligence agencyWednesday’s DDoS attacks appeared less impactful than the earlier onslaught — with targeted sites soon reachable again — as emergency responders blunted them. Zhora’s office, Ukraine’s information protection agency, said responders switched to a different DDoS protection service provider. Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at the network management firm Kentik Inc., recorded two attack waves each lasting more than an hour.A spokesman for California-based Cloudflare, which provides services to some of the targeted sites, said DDoS attacks in Ukraine have been sporadic and on the rise in the past month but “relatively modest compared to large DDoS attacks we’ve handled in the past.”The West blames Russia’s GRU for some of the most damaging cyberattacks on record, including a pair in 2015 and 2016 that briefly knocked out parts of Ukraine’s power grid and the NotPetya “wiper” virus of 2017, which caused more than $10 billion of damage globally by infecting companies that do business in Ukraine with malware seeded through a tax preparation software update.The wiper malware detected in Ukraine this year has so far been manually activated, as opposed to a worm like NotPetya, which can spread out of control across borders.ALSO READ | Ukraine declares 30-day nationwide state of emergency amid war fears with Russia"

29e8f5335f47dcb2903a446b550396fc,"Trump targets postal voting, says 2020 presidential polls may be 'fraudulent'President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.The dates of presidential elections — the Tuesday after the first Monday in November in every fourth year — are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change. The Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration.Still, the mere suggestion of the delay was extraordinary in a nation that has held itself up as a beacon to the world for its history of peaceful transfer of power.Trump tweeted Thursday: “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???”Trump's tweet came on a day of bad economic news and amid a dark political patch for his reelection effort.The government reported Thursday that U.S. economy shrank at a dizzying 32.9% annual rate in the April-June quarter, by far the worst quarterly plunge ever, as the coronavirus outbreak shut down businesses, threw tens of millions out of work and sent unemployment surging to 14.7%.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Quick Highlights:________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________And Trump trails in the polls, nationally and across battleground states, and some surveys even suggest traditionally Republican-leaning states could be in play. While Trump has come back before after trailing consistently in the polls throughout 2016, it’s raised the possibility that he could face a landslide loss if he doesn’t turn things around.There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting, even in states with all-mail votes. Five states already rely exclusively on mail-in ballots, and they say they have necessary safeguards in place to ensure that a hostile foreign actor doesn’t disrupt the vote. Election security experts say that all forms of voter fraud are rare, including absentee balloting.Trump has increasingly sought to cast doubt on November's election and the expected surge in mail-in and absentee voting as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. And Trump has called remote voting options the “biggest risk” to his reelection. His campaign and the Republican Party have sued to combat the practice, which was once a significant advantage for the GOP.Trump refused in an interview just weeks ago with Fox News to commit to accept the results of the upcoming White House election, recalling a similar threat he made weeks before the 2016 vote.“I have to see. Look ... I have to see,” Trump told moderator Chris Wallace during a wide-ranging interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “No, I’m not going to just say ‘yes.’ I’m not going to say ‘no,’ and I didn’t last time, either.”Trump and many members of his administration have previously availed themselves of absentee voting, but Trump has sought to differentiate that from a growing push by states to mail all registered voters either ballots or absentee request forms.Voters and public health officials have expressed concerns about the potential dangers for spreading the virus during in-person voting, and states have reported difficulty filling poll worker positions given the pandemic.Last month, Trump told supporters in Arizona that “This will be, in my opinion, the most corrupt election in the history of our country.""There appears to be next-to-no appetite in the Capitol for a change to the Nov. 3 election. Democrats have pushed to includes billions of dollars in the next coronavirus relief bill to fund election security and accessibility improvements for this year's vote, but Trump and Republicans have so far resisted those efforts.Just months ago, in April, Trump had ruled out the prospect of trying to change the election. “I never even thought of changing the date of the election,"" he said. ""Why would I do that? November 3rd. It’s a good number. No, I look forward to that election.”“I’m not thinking about it at all,"" he added. ""Not at all.”Attorney General William Barr, speaking to a House committee earlier this week, claimed there was “a high risk” that mail-in voting would lead to “massive” fraud. He said he had no “reason to think” the upcoming election would be rigged. But he said he believed “if you have wholesale mail-in voting, it substantially increases the risk of fraud.”Rep. Cedric Richmond, D.-La., asked Barr at the hearing whether a sitting U.S. president could move the election date. Barr responded: “Actually, I haven’t looked into that question under the Constitution.”"

It also banned all textile exports and prohibited any country from authorizing new work permits for North Korean workers - two key sources of hard currency for the northeast Asian nation.Haley told the council Friday that the new resolution ""bans all remaining categories of major North Korean exports - a loss of nearly $250 million in revenue to the regime."""
857994a8d1f27e6e50a06cc9aedb42a2,"The two-day G20 Summit beginning at Hamburg tomorrow is likely to be dominated by issues like terrorism, climate change and global trade. The Summit will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders from the world’s other top economies. Any possible meeting between Modi, who is expected to have a number of bilateral meetings on the sidelines during his two-day stay in this port city, and Chinese President Xi Jinping will be keenly watched in the wake of the recent spat between the two countries over developments near Sikkim.  The Summit, with a theme of ‘Shaping an Inter-connected World’, is taking place at a time when differences have emerged among several leaders expected to be present—mostly on publicly stated views of the US President Donald Trump—including on issues like climate change and open trade.    Other top leaders expected to be present include Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May of the UK.    The ‘Group of Twenty’ is made up of 19 countries and the European Union. The countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the UK and the US.  While Hamburg happens to be city of birth for the Summit host and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, it is also known as an ‘anti-establishment bastion’ of Left-wing radicals.  At least 30 protests are expected to be held here ahead of the Summit that may attract thousands of people, including from anti-capitalist groups.   Local authorities expect these protests to remain peaceful and around 15,000 police personnel will be deployed to protect the venue. Besides, nearly 4,000 personnel will keep a tab on the airport and train security.  While counter-terrorism and economic reforms will dominate the discussions, the 12th G20 Summit will also discuss issues like free and open trade, climate change, migration, sustainable development and global stability.  Modi, who is reaching Hamburg after a visit to Israel, said in a Facebook post before his departure from India that he is looking forward to “engaging leaders from other G20 countries on the vital issues affecting our world today that have a bearing on economic growth, sustainable development, and peace and stability”. The prime minister said the world leaders will review progress on decisions since the Hangzhou Summit last year and deliberate on issues of terrorism, climate, sustainable development, growth and trade, digitisation, health, employment, migration, women’s empowerment, and partnership with Africa. He further said he is looking forward to the opportunity to meet leaders on the sidelines of the Summit to exchange views on bilateral matters of mutual interest.  The Summit will begin tomorrow with Merkel welcoming the world leaders, followed by ‘G20 Leaders’ Retreat’ where the topic of discussion will be ‘fighting terrorism’.  The first working session will be on ‘global growth and trade’, followed by the second session on ‘sustainable development, climate and energy’. The world leaders will also attend a musical concert tomorrow evening, followed by a dinner for them and their spouses. The second day of the Summit will begin with the third working session on ‘partnership with Africa, migration and health’ while the fourth working session will be on ‘digitisation, women’s empowerment and employment’.  These two will be followed by a closing session on Saturday evening, after which a joint statement by the G20 leaders will be issued.(With PTI inputs)"

62f019d6c338d5f0d2778854feec0a8e,"Donald Trump/FILEThe Trump administration has said it won't join a global effort to develop, manufacture and equitably distribute a coronavirus vaccine, in part because the World Health Organisation is involved, according to a report in the Washington Post. This comes as part of Washington's plan to not work with the WHO, which President Donald Trump has criticised over what he characterized as its ""China-centric"" response to the pandemic. As many as 170 countries are in talks to take part in the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (Covax) Facility that aims to speed vaccine development, secure doses for all countries and distribute them. The plan, co-led by the WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the vaccine alliance, was of interest to some members of the Trump administration. It is also backed by traditional U.S. allies including Japan, Germany and the European Commission. ""The United States will continue to engage our intrnational partners to ensure we defeat the virus, but we will not be constrained by multilateral organisations influenced by the corrupt World Health Organisation and China,"" Judd Deere, a spokesman for the White House was quoted as saying by the Washington Post. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, was of the view that America was taking a huge gamble by taking a go-it-alone strategy. On the other hand, Kendall Hoyt, an assistant professor at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine, opined that the move was akin to opting out of an insurance policy. Hoyt said that the U.S. could be pursuing bilateral deals with drug companies and simultaneously participating in Covax, increasing its odds of getting some doses of the first safe vaccine. "

12a2f9cead1c1fdf9f0deec8ad242acb,"US: Hospitalizations skyrocket in kids too young for COVID shots. Hospitalizations of US children under 5 with COVID-19 soared in recent weeks to their highest level since the pandemic began, according to government data released Friday on the only age group not yet eligible for the vaccine.The worrisome trend in children too young to be vaccinated underscores the need for older kids and adults to get their shots to help protect those around them, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Since mid-December, with the highly contagious omicron variant spreading furiously around the country, the hospitalization rate in these youngest kids has surged to more than 4 in 100,000 children, up from 2.5 per 100,000.The rate among children ages 5 to 17 is about 1 per 100,000, according to the CDC data, which is drawn from over 250 hospitals in 14 states.Overall, “pediatric hospitalizations are at their highest rate compared to any prior point in the pandemic,” Walensky said.She noted that just over 50% of children ages 12 to 18, and only 16% of those 5 to 11, are fully vaccinated.The overall hospitalization rate among children and teens is still lower than that of any other age group. And they account for less than 5% of average new daily hospital admissions, according to the CDC.As of Tuesday, the average number of under-18 patients admitted to the hospital per day with COVID-19 was 766, double the figure reported just two weeks ago.The trend among the very youngest kids is being driven by high hospitalization rates in five states: Georgia, Connecticut, Tennessee, California and Oregon, with the steepest increases in Georgia, the CDC said.At a briefing, Walensky said the numbers include children hospitalized because of COVID-19 and those admitted for other reasons but found to be infected.The CDC also said the surge could be partially attributable to how COVID-19 hospitalizations in this age group are defined: a positive virus test within 14 days of hospitalization for any reason.The severity of illness among children during the omicron wave seems lower than it was with the delta variant, said Seattle Children’s Hospital critical care chief Dr. John McGuire.“Most of the COVID+ kids in the hospital are actually not here for COVID-19 disease,” McGuire said in an email. “They are here for other issues but happen to have tested positive.”The nation’s top infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said earlier this week that omicron appears to cause less-severe disease across the board, but that the sheer number of infections because of its extreme contagiousness will mean that many more children will get infected, and a certain share of them will wind up in the hospital.Fauci also said many children hospitalized with COVID-19 have other health conditions that make them more susceptible to complications from the virus. That includes obesity, diabetes and lung disease.Fauci and Walensky have emphasized that one of the best ways to protect the youngest children is to vaccinate everyone else.The surge in hospitalizations only heightens some parents’ worries.Emily Hojara and Eli Zilke of Sawyer, Michigan, are being extra protective of their daughter Flora, who turns 2 in May. They limit her contact with other children, and no visitors are allowed in the house unless masked, not even grandparents.“It’s been a struggle, and now with this new variant, I feel it’s knocked us back,” Hojara said.“It’s scary that she can’t be vaccinated,” she said of her daughter.Dr. Jennifer Kusma, a pediatrician with Chicago’s Lurie Children’s Hospital, said she has seen increasing numbers of kids hospitalized with omicron, and while most aren’t severely ill, she understands parents’ worries.“I really wish we already had that vaccine for these young kids,” Kusma said. But she added that what may seem like a long wait should reassure parents that vaccine testing is not being rushed.Many had hoped the new year might bring a vaccine for young children, but Pfizer announced last month that two doses didn’t offer as much protection as hoped for in youngsters 2 to 4.Pfizer’s study has been updated to give everyone under 5 a third dose, and data is expected in early spring.Also on Friday, the CDC issued a report showing Pfizer shots seem to protect older children who develop a serious but rare COVID-19-linked condition that involves inflammation of multiple organs.Among 102 kids ages 12 to 18 who were hospitalized with the condition, none who had received two Pfizer shots at least 28 days earlier needed ventilators or other advanced life support. By contrast, 40% of unvaccinated children required such treatment.The condition, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, causes symptoms that may include persistent fever, abdominal pain and rashes. Most children recover, but 55 deaths have been reported.A separate CDC report found that children who had COVID-19 were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes as youngsters who had not had the virus. Scientists are investigating why but say the virus seems to attack insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. ALSO READ: United States: Joe Biden urges concern but not alarm as omicron cases risesALSO READ: COVID: New cases soar to highest levels on record in United States"

However, it is this very advantage that becomes a shortcoming when these masks are worn by people exhibiting symptoms of infection.Says the New Scientist report, “N95 respirators can also make it more difficult for a person to breathe, so could be dangerous for someone showing symptoms of infection of the new coronavirus, which include coughing and shortness of breath.”ALSO READ: Kerala confirms third case of novel Coronavirus; 75 kept under isolationALSO READ: Coronavirus can be treated by cow urine, dung, says Hindu Mahasabha president"

Since Monday, with the resignation of the prime minister, there is no functioning finance minister.Weerasinghe said currently the country's foreign reserves were not enough to import even the essentials.""With the continuation of this situation, we will have to suffer power cuts between 10-12 hours,” he warned.He said the 225 members of Parliament and the executive president have to resolve the political crisis.Shortly after taking over last month as the apex bank's chief, Weerasinghe announced defaulting on Sri Lanka's external debt, saying the country had no money to pay its creditors.Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948.Clashes broke out on Monday after government's supporters attacked peaceful anti-government protest sites in Colombo and elsewhere, killing at least 8 people and leaving over 200 others injured in the violence.Sri Lanka’s worst economic crisis has provoked widespread protests calling for political reform and the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.On April 1, President Rajapaksa imposed a state of emergency, lifting it five days later.The government reimposed a state of emergency on May 6 after police fired teargas and arrested students protesting near parliament, which was adjourned until May 17.Although the protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful, the police fatally shot a protester on April 19, and on several occasions have used teargas and water cannons against protesters.The authorities have made numerous arrests and repeatedly imposed curfews.The political crisis was triggered in late March when people hurt by long hours of power cuts and essential shortages took to the streets demanding the resignation of the government.President Rajapaksa sacked his cabinet and appointed a younger cabinet as a response to the demand for resignation.A continuous protest opposite his secretariat has now gone on for well over a month.Last Monday, his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned as the prime minister to make way for the president to appoint an interim all political party government.Two days of talks have not been successful. The island nation is under curfew as violence erupted on Monday. The ruling party politicians have seen their properties being set ablaze.Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday deployed troops and military vehicles in the streets to ensure public security in the Capital amidst nationwide protests over the government's failure to tackle the worst economic crisis.The deployment came a day after the country'Cs Ministry of Defence ordered the Army, the Air Force and the Navy personnel to open fire on anyone looting public property or causing harm to others amidst violent protests in the island nation over the unprecedented economic crisis.ALSO READ | Sri Lanka’s ex-PM Mahinda Rajapaksa protected at Trincomalee naval base amid protests in countryALSO READ | Sri Lankan army chief denies shoot-at-sight orders; assures of 'no disgraceful acts' by armed forces"

fed66d6f73173920f0f50ee532beeb28,"Defence, agriculture, trade, diplomacy and water management will dominate talks when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Israel from July 4-6 at the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the first Indian Prime Minister to visit the Jewish homeland.Modi is also expected to meet Moshe Holtzberg, a survivor of the 2008 Mumbai 26/11 terrorist attack. Moshe was two years old when the attack happened.“Ahead of the visit, both countries have prepared a roadmap of joint economic undertakings,” The Haaretz reported on June 29, 2017. “The Israeli cabinet approved a 23-page document continuing scores of bilateral measures and a budget of 280 million shekels (about $79.6 million or Rs 514 crore) – a bigger sum than Israel has ever set aside for China, Africa and Latin America combined. No fewer than 11 ministries were involved in preparing the program.”India is Israel’s top destination for arms exports, buying 41% of Israel’s arms export between 2012 and 2016, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent global conflict and arms-research institute.Israel is India’s third-largest source of arms, with a 7.2% share of imports between 2012 and 2016, next to the USA (14%) and Russia (68%).Five reasons why Israel matters to India and PM Narendra ModiThe earliest signs of collaboration came during the 1962 Sino-Indian war, when Israel provided India military aid. Israel also assisted India during two wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971, according to this 2009 article in the Stanford Journal of International Relations.India reciprocated during the six-day war in 1967 by providing Israel with spare parts for French-made Mystere and Ouragan aircraft as well as AX-13 tanks (also French-made), the Stanford report said.The highlight of the partnership was Israel’s supply of artillery shells during the Kargil war in 1999 when India faced a shortage.In the late 1990s, a crucial defence deal was the Indian purchase of Barak 1, an air-defence missile, bought specifically for its capability to intercept US-made Harpoon missiles deployed by Pakistan.India’s imports of unarmed vehicles (UAVs) have almost all been from Israel. Of 176 UAVs purchased from Israel, 108 are Searcher UAVs and 68 are Heron UAVs, IndiaSpend reported in May 2015.In April 2017, India and Israel signed a $2 billion (Rs 12,878 crore) deal for advanced medium-range surface-to-air missile system, which will provide the Indian army the capability to shoot down aircraft, missiles and drones at ranges of up to 70 km.In September 2016, tests were conducted of the jointly developed Long Range Surface-to-Air Missile with a range of 70 km, intended to equip three guided-missile destroyers of the Indian Navy.India successfully tested the Israeli-made SPYDER quick-reaction surface-to-air missile in May this year. The Indian Air Force is planning to deploy this system on its western border, India Today reported on February 28, 2017.India and Israel also closely cooperate on counter-terrorism issues through a joint working group on counter-terrorism.Several ministerial and high-level official visits to Israel precede Modi’s tour. These include visits by LK Advani, former home minister, in 2000, former President APJ Abdul Kalam in February 2008, home minister Rajnath Singh in November 2014, President Pranab Mukherjee in October 2015 and external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj in January 2016.Three Indian naval ships, destroyer INS Mumbai, frigate INS Trishul and tanker INS Aditya, made a goodwill visit at the Haifa port in May 2017 to mark 25 years of full diplomatic relations between the two countries.An Indo-Israel agriculture action plan for 2015-18 is operational, and 15 of the proposed 26 centers of excellence in agriculture are being developed in India with Israel’s help to showcase the latest technology to Indian farmers.Phase-I (2010-12) and phase-II (2012-15) of the agreement are complete, according to this reply to the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament) on February 7, 2017.India has benefited from Israeli technologies in horticulture mechanisation, protected cultivation, orchard and canopy management, nursery management, micro-irrigation and post-harvest management, particularly in Haryana and Maharashtra.Every year, more than 20,000 farmers visit the Agricultural Centre of Excellence at Gharaunda in Karnal, Haryana, where a nursery produces hybrid seedlings–including tomatoes, cherry-tomato, colored capsicum, cucumbers, eggplant and chilli pepper–grown in small, individual cells, ready to be transplanted into containers or a field.There was a five-to 10-fold increase in crop yields with an accompanying 65% reduction in use of water and noticeable decrease in the use of pesticides and fertilisers, according to this December 2014 report on the Indo-Israel Agriculture Project.Five reasons why Israel matters to India and PM Narendra ModiOn June 28, 2017, the union cabinet approved a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Israel on the National Campaign for Water Conservation in India.Technologically-adept Israel has developed water-management technologies, located as it is in a semi-arid region with limited sources of fresh drinking water.India and Israel had earlier signed an MoU on water resources management and development cooperation in November 2016.Israel was India’s 38th largest trading partner, with trade of $5.02 billion (Rs 33,634 crore) in 2016-17, down 18% over 2012-13. The trade balance stood in India’s favour at $1.10 billion (Rs 7,370 crore) in 2016-17.Five reasons why Israel matters to India and PM Narendra ModiMineral fuels and oils are India’s leading export to Israel, worth $1.01 billion in 2016-17.India’s major imports from Israel in 2016-17 included natural or cultured pearls and precious stones, worth $1.11 billion.Trade in diamonds accounts for nearly 54% of the bilateral trade. Nearly 40 diamond dealers from India have opened offices at the Israeli diamond exchange in Ramat-Gan. Some of these dealers have been active in Israel for nearly 30-40 years.Israeli exporters complain about the difficulties in doing business in India “because of its onerous regulations, corruption and the division of the country into multiple jurisdictions of 29 states each with their own policies and rules”, the Haaretz reported.The Israeli government has proposed measures such as “offering export insurance, liberalising the aviation sector and granting longer-term visas”. The aim is to boost Israeli exports to India by 25% over the next four years and tourists to 80,000 annually.“Relations with Israel are significant for India because of cooperation in agriculture, defence and science/technology,” Uttara Sahasrabuddhe, professor of international relations at the University of Mumbai, told IndiaSpend.“Israel has been giving key weapons systems to India including missiles; it has given us those weapons which we could not directly buy from the US for ideological reasons; cooperation in counter-terrorism from information sharing to techniques/doctrine of counter terrorism,” Sahasrabudde said. “It is also an important source of foreign investment, if tapped with care. The visit of the Indian PM will indicate that New Delhi has come out of the old mindset.”Modi’s visit is of “unprecedented importance with bilateral ties going through changing paradigm and changed architecture,” Israeli Ambassador to India Daniel Carmon was quoted as saying in the Economic Times on June 28, 2017. “… there is no zero sum game and commitments and good relations with both sides can be maintained without contradiction.”Modi will be received by his Israeli counterpart at the airport along with a “top protocol team” comprising Israelis from various fields including rabbis. This is a special gesture only accorded to the Pope or the US President, the Ambassador said.The announcement has generated excitement among Israelis. The Israeli Embassy in India has tweeted a video where Israelis welcome the Indian Prime Minister in Hindi.An estimated 85,000 Jews of Indian-origin live in Israel, the majority being from Maharashtra (Bene Israelis), with some from Kerala (Cochini Jews) and Kolkata (Baghdadi Jews).While India recognised Israel on September 17, 1950–a year after it voted against United Nations’ membership for the Jewish state–full diplomatic ties were established only in 1992, the reticence flowing from India’s traditional backing for the Palestinian cause.Since then, relationships have been defined by defence deals and the 35,000 mostly young Israelis who visit India each year to de-stress after their compulsory two-three years of military service.The traffic isn’t all one-way: As many as 44,672 Indian tourists visited Israel in 2016, a 13% increase over the previous year, Financial Express reported on April 24, 2017.(Indiaspend.org is a data-driven, public-interest journalism non-profit organisation)"

The next day, Pakistan Air Force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured its pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was handed over to India on March 1.Lauding the PAF pilots in the National Assembly, Qureshi said, ""Pakistan Air Force shot down two Indian aircraft violating the Pakistani airspace. One Indian jet was shot down by Squadron Leader Hassan Siddiqui while other was downed by Wing Commander Nauman Ali Khan.""Qureshi officially identified Wing Commander Nauman Ali Khan as the Pakistan Air Force pilot who shot down the second Indian fighter jet in the dogfight last week, Dawn news reported.Pakistani military on February 27 claimed that two Indian IAF were hit. One plane crashed in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir while the other fell in Jammu and Kashmir after being hit.India has maintained that Pakistan downed a MiG-21 aircraft of the IAF while Indian Air Force shot down an F-16 jet of the PAF during the dogfight.The foreign minister made the statement after Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, during his speech, praised Squadron Leader Siddiqui for downing the IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman's MiG-21 jet on February 27.""One clarification: Bilawal paid tribute to Hassan Siddiqui as he's absolutely a national hero,"" Qureshi said.""But I would like to clarify that two Indian planes were shot down.

He is currently in his second five-year term and was due to retire in 2023 under the old two-term system.Xi is already regarded as the most powerful leader of China after Mao as he held the posts of head of the CPC, the military and the Presidency, which is mostly ceremonial.The NPC was also expected to endorse another draft constitutional amendment to enshrine Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in the fundamental law.   This will make Xi the only leader after Mao and Deng Xiaoping whose thoughts were written into the Constitution. It would place him above the rest of the leaders of the party. The thoughts of two of Xi's predecessors were mentioned in the Constitution but not their names. The draft suggests Xi Jinping Thought be juxtaposed with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the Theory of Three Represents as a new guiding theory in the preamble of the Constitution. Scientific Outlook on Development is also proposed to be constitutionalised this time, according to the official media.  (With inputs from agencies)"
701b1cc93c48c47e51d9b00df6234188,"Nikki Haley slams Joe Biden’s immigration policyRepublican politician Nikki Haley Tuesday slammed President-elect Joe Biden’s immigration policy claiming it will hurt American workers and “insult” legal immigrants.“Biden’s immigration policies will create another border crisis that will undermine the rule of law, hurt American workers, and insult the legal immigrants who did the right thing,” Indian-American Haley said in a series of tweets.“It’s one more reason why America needs a conservative-led Senate to stop Biden’s plan in its tracks,” she said, seeking votes for two Republican Senators in the Georgia Senate race next month. The Republican Party currently has 50 Senators in the 100-member Senate, while the Democrats has 48.A Republican majority in the Senate along with the two wins in Georgia Senate race is essential for the party to maintain its hold in the national politics. The party has lost control of the White House and the House of Representatives.“Biden has promised to reverse the Trump admin’s immigration policies, halt all deportations, & introduce amnesty legislation for illegal immigrants on day 1,” Haley said.“The amnesty bill would send a clear signal to people across the world: Come to America illegally & get rewarded for it,” said the former two-term Governor of South Carolina. She was the first ever Cabinet-ranking official in any administration after President Donald Trump nominated her as the US Ambassador to the United Nations.A day earlier, Haley in a series of tweets was critical of the foreign policies of President-elect Biden.“Biden stated he wanted to return to the disastrous Iran deal that he helped orchestrate as VP. The Trump administration’s foreign policy made the Middle East safer & more secure. It would be a huge mistake for Biden to go running back into the arms of Iran’s ayatollahs,” she said."

The U.S. Mission to the United Nations said Ambassador Nikki Haley would hold a news conference Thursday in Washington to highlight its findings as well as Iran's ""destabilizing activities in the Middle East region and elsewhere in the world.""In the report, Guterres stressed that the nuclear deal remains ""the best way"" to ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program.He said President Donald Trump's Oct. 13 decision not to certify the agreement under U.S. law created ""considerable uncertainty"" about its future.  But, he added, ""I am reassured that the United States has expressed its commitment to stay in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for now.""Trump, however, has left open the possibility of pulling out of the nuclear deal.Guterres welcomed support for the treaty from its other parties — China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, the European Union and numerous other countries.""I encourage the United States to maintain its commitments to the plan and to consider the broader implications for the region before taking any further steps,"" he said. ""Similarly, I encourage the Islamic Republic of Iran to carefully consider the concerns raised by other participants in the plan.""Trump has called the agreement a bad deal, and the U.S. has focused especially on its time limits and a provision in the Security Council resolution that calls on Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.Guterres said the U.N. is studying debris from missiles fired at Yanbu in Saudi Arabia on July 22 and at the capital of Riyadh on Nov. 4 and also is reviewing other information.He said France, Germany, Britain and the United States sent a letter saying the Simorgh Space Launch Vehicle that Iran launched on July 27, if configured as a ballistic missile, is ""inherently capable of delivering nuclear weapons.""But Guterres said Russia, an ally of Iran, sent a letter Aug. 16 that the Security Council resolution contains only a ""call"" for Iran to forgo missile work — not a prohibition. He said Iran says the launch vehicle was ""part of a scientific and technological activity related to the use of space technology"" that it is determined to pursue.The Security Council discussed the launch on Sept. 8, and ""there was no consensus among council members"" on how it related to the 2015 resolution, Guterres said.He said Israel protested that Iran's test of a Qiam ballistic missile on Nov. 15, 2016 ""used a Star of David as the intended target,"" and citied other ballistic missiles it reportedly launched at targets in Syria on June 18-19. France, Germany, Britain and the U.S. also raised these tests as well as the test of a medium-range missile July 4.The secretary-general said Iran called Israel's claim of a specifically marked target ""a sheer falsehood."" Iran also said its ""military capabilities, including ballistic missiles, have not been designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons and thus are outside the purview of the Security Council resolution,"" Guterres said."

""We are going to raise the issue with them (the US)"", said a source. The defence and security ties between India and the US have been on an upswing. In June 2016, the US had designated India a ""Major Defence Partner"" intending to elevate defence trade and technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners. The Army last week had clearly indicated that it would take retaliatory action against the killing of four army men. The sources said that Pakistan has been escalating the hostilities along the LoC and in hinterland in J-K to vitiate the atmosphere ahead of panchayat polls in the state."
b8853b37c0ad6abaa634139eb9717582,"Coronavirus impact: 10 percent recovered patients in Wuhan test coronavirus positive againAs the number of new cases of coronavirus are increasing globally, about 10 percent of recovered patients of coronavirus in China have test positive again after being discharged from the hospital. According to news agency ANI,doctors from Tongji hospital on the frontlines of the outbreak in Wuhan--where the virus emerged--told state broadcaster CCTV that they have found no evidence that these patients who again tested positive became infectious. The Chinese mainland, where the disease first emerged last December, has discharged over 90 percent of its infected patients and around 4300 confirmed patients are still recieving treatment in hospital. The country has reported at least 81,000 cases and more than 3,200 deaths, but most of the new cases have been confirmed. The hospital confirmed that five of 147 patients--only over 3 to 5 percent--tested positive agains in nucleic acid tests, according to state broadcaster CCTV. ""So far there is no evidence to suggest that they are infectious,"" said Wang Wei, the hospital's president. He said the five patients who tested positive again did not have any symptoms and none of their close contacts had been infected. In spite of its relatively small sample size, the research of the Tongji hospital, which identified the first COVID-19 case, is especially relevant as China now has far more recovered patients than news confirmed cases. Wang added that surveillance of similar patients showed that 80 percent to 90 percent had no trace of the virus in their system one month after being discharged from the hospital, according to the report. But, he said, these are just ""small samples"" and ""not enough to assure us of the validity of our initial findings.""The hospital's president said: ""We need a large -scale epidemiological study to guide our disease surveillance and preventive works.""Researchers around the world are trying to determine whether recovered patients can still infect people with the coronavirus that causes the disease and if they have developed antibodies offering them immunity to the diseases. Manwhile, other quarantine facilities in Wuhan have seen about 5 percent to 10 percent of their recovered patients test positive again. The findings were reported by the health news outlet Life Times, which is affiliated which state-run newspaper People's Daily. The studies come as health officials around the world are testing the concept of taking plasma from someone who has been infected, processing it and injecting the antibodies into a sick person to stimulate their immune system. (With inputs from ANI)ALSO READ | COVID-19 Crisis: Top Headlines At This Hour   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

41302b59d577bb00fbcd084195b262bc,"NBC News fired longtime “Today” show host Matt Lauer on Wednesday for “inappropriate sexual behavior,” making him the second morning television show personality to lose his job because of sexual misconduct charges in a week.Lauer’s co-host Savannah Guthrie made the announcement at the top of Wednesday’s “Today” show. Last week, CBS News fired Charlie Rose after complaints from several women who worked for him.NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack said the network had received a complaint from a colleague on Monday night, and a review determined it was a clear violation of company standards. While it was the first complaint lodged against Lauer, Lack said in a memo to staff that “we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.”Lauer, 59, has hosted “Today” for two decades. When paired with Katie Couric, “Today” was the longtime ratings leader and was highly lucrative for NBC. It now runs second in the ratings to ABC’s “Good Morning America.”Many “Today” show viewers took out their anger for the unsightly 2012 firing of co-host Ann Curry on Lauer, sending the show plunging in the ratings. But NBC stuck with Lauer and the show had steadied with his pairing with Guthrie. The show runs for four hours, with Lauer and Guthrie hosting the first two.He joins a lengthening list of media figures felled by sexual misconduct charges this year. Besides Rose, they include Lauer’s former NBC News colleague Mark Halperin, former Fox News prime-time host Bill O’Reilly and National Public Radio newsroom chief Michael Oreskes. The New York Times suspended White House correspondent Glenn Thrush last week.Lack, in his memo, said that “we are deeply saddened by this turn of events. But we will face it together as a news organization — and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.”Guthrie co-hosted Wednesday’s show with Hoda Kotb, who said both of them were wakened with the news Wednesday morning. Guthrie appeared emotional and appeared to fight back tears as she called Lauer her friend who is beloved by many at NBC, and said she was “heartbroken for my colleague who came forward to tell her story and any other women who have their own stories to tell.“We are grappling with a dilemma that so many people have faced these past few weeks,” she said. “How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly? I don’t know the answer to that. But I do know that this reckoning that so many organizations have been going through is important, it’s long overdue and it must result in workplaces where all women, all people, feel safe and respected.”On Twitter Wednesday, President Donald Trump said “Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for ‘inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.’ But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News.”"
c6c1e07b29f080a26a3310735608cd9d,"President Donald Trump said he will not let Bashar al-Assad get away with using chemical weapons on his people in Syria, as he slammed his predecessor Barack Obama for not taking enough action on ""horrible acts against humanity"" in in the war-ravaged country. ""Had President Obama gone across that line and done what he should have done, I don't believe you'd have Russia and I don't believe you'd have Iran to anywhere near the extent, and maybe not at all, in Syria today,"" Trump told reporters at a joint news conference with visiting Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri yesterday. ""I am not a fan of Assad. I certainly think that what he's done to that country (Syria) and to humanity is horrible. I have been saying that for a long time. I am not somebody that will stand by and let him get away with what he tried to do,"" he said. In the ""red line"" warning of 2013, Obama responded to reports that Assad had used chemical weapons by saying he would meet further chemical weapons use with force. Later, Assad again used chemical weapons, and Obama opted to have Russia step in to remove them. ""He (Assad) did it a number of times when President Obama drew the red line in the sand, and then he should have crossed that red line, because some horrible acts against humanity took place, including gas and the killing through gases. That was a bad day for this country,"" Trump said.     He said the US is having extraordinary success against the ISIS. ""One of the things that we have made tremendous strides at is getting rid of ISIS. We have generals that don't like to talk, they like to do,"" he said.     Trump said the US has made ""tremendous strides"" against the Islamic State terror group in Syria, Iraq and other locations. ""Our military is an incredible fighting force. And as you know, I let the commanders on the ground do what they had to do,"" he said. The US president added that before he took charge, ""The commanders had to call the White House and speak to people that didn't know what was happening, where they were, what locations, practically, probably never heard of the countries they were talking about or the towns."" Responding to another question, Trump said he would be making his position clear on the Hezbollah clear in the next 24 hours. ""I'll be making my position very clear over the next 24 hours. We're going to see what is exactly taking place. I have meetings with some of my very expert military representatives and others. So I'll be making that decision very shortly,"" he said."

A Ukrainian airplane carrying at least 170 people crashed on Wednesday shortly after takeoff from Tehran’s main airport, killing all onboard, state TV reported. A pilot error is unlikely to have caused the crash of Ukraine's Boeing 737 near Tehran,  the vice president of operations at the Ukraine International Airlines said Wednesday.  ""We know, as of today, that the aircraft went to the altitude of 2,400 meters (7,874 feet). The crew mistake is minimal. We simply do not consider it. Considering their experience, it is very hard to say that it could somehow be about the crew,"" Sputnik quoted vice president of operations at the Ukraine International Airlines sIgor Sosnovsky as saying at a briefing.He further added that all crew members had enough experience and flight hours to have made any kind of mistake..According to the Iranian and Ukrainian officials, the crash, which happened shortly after take-off from Imam Khomeini airport in Tehran, left no survivors.Evgeny Dykhne, the company president, said that the crashed aircraft was one of the best at the Ukraine International Airlines.Dykhne said the company had ""no right out to work out its own theories (of what happened),"" adding that a special investigative panel was to put forward possible versions.In the meantime, The Iraqi Prime Ministry said that Iran had notified Iraq shortly after midnight that its response to the killing of its top military commander had begun, and that retaliation would be limited to locations where the U.S. military is present. Adel Abdul-Mahdi’s office said in a statement Wednesday that Iraq was simultaneously informed by the Americans that military bases in Ain al-Asad and Irbil were under missile attack.The office says it has received no reports of casualties on the Iraqi side and has not been officially notified of any losses among the U.S.-led coalition.“Iraq refuses any violation of its sovereignty and any attacks on its territory,” the statement said.It added that Iraq is doing everything in its power to contain the situation to avoid a “devastating all-out war.""Also Read | Soleimani killing: Iran fires multiple missiles at Iraqi bases housing US forces ALSO READ | Video | Multiple Iranian missiles hit Iraq airbase; locals scream, run for safetyALSO READ | Trump tweets 'All is well' after Iran bombs Iraqi bases housing US troops, to issue statement later "

It wasn't clear what the rules are and what prompted the change, but it comes as China tightens its already strict COVID-19 travel restrictions in the face of a growing outbreak in the city of Xi'an and ahead of the Winter Olympics in Beijing in six weeks.Xi'an, which is about 1,000 km (600 miles) southwest of Beijing, reported more than 300 new cases over the weekend, a sharp rise from previous days. The city of 13 million people has been locked down, with only one person per household allowed out every two days to shop for necessities.The Delta flight that turned back to Seattle last week left passengers with expired COVID-19 test results and US visas, according to Chinese media reports. The consulate in San Francisco did not name Delta but said in a short statement Sunday that many flights from the US to China had been delayed or cancelled in recent days including a flight that turned back more than halfway to its destination. The consulate “had made a stern representation to the airline,” the statement said.Also Read | France logs over 1 lakh daily Covid-19 cases for first timeAlso Read | Omicron will spike Covid cases 'much higher': Dr Fauci   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_9536783381 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/12/0_g44jqltg/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_g44jqltg_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Omicron cases rise to 449, 7 states of India emerge as hotspots"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""38"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_9536783381 = ''; jwsetup_9536783381(); function jwsetup_9536783381() { jwvidplayer_9536783381 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_9536783381"").setup(jwconfig_9536783381); jwvidplayer_9536783381.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_9536783381, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_g44jqltg\"", ns_st_pr=\""Omicron cases rise to 449, 7 states of India emerge as hotspots\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Omicron cases rise to 449, 7 states of India emerge as hotspots\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Omicron cases rise to 449, 7 states of India emerge as hotspots\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-12-26\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-12-26\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/12/0_g44jqltg/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_9536783381.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_9536783381.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_9536783381.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_9536783381.stop(); jwvidplayer_9536783381.remove(); jwvidplayer_9536783381 = ''; jwsetup_9536783381(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_9536783381.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_9536783381.stop(); jwvidplayer_9536783381.remove(); jwvidplayer_9536783381 = ''; jwsetup_9536783381(); return; }); jwvidplayer_9536783381.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9536783381.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9536783381.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9536783381.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9536783381.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_9536783381.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

A lawsuit that CNN brought against the Trump administration over the issue is continuing.U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, an appointee of President Donald Trump, announced his decision following a hearing. The judge said Acosta's credentials would be returned immediately and reactivated to allow him access to the White House.CNN had asked the judge to force the White House to return the credentials that give Acosta, CNN's chief White House correspondent, access to the White House complex for press briefings and other events.The judge granted CNN's request for a temporary restraining order. A lawsuit that CNN brought against the Trump administration over the issue is continuing.The White House revoked Acosta's credentials after he and Trump tangled during a press conference last week.The judge said the government could not say who initially decided to revoke Acosta's hard pass. The White House had spelled out its reasons for revoking his credentials in a tweet from White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and in a statement after CNN filed its lawsuit. But the judge said those ""belated efforts were hardly sufficient to satisfy due process.""The judge also found that Acosta suffered ""irreparable harm,"" dismissing the government's argument that CNN could simply send other reporters to cover the White House in Acosta's place.The suit by CNN alleges that Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights were violated by suspending his hard pass. While the judge didn't rule on the underlying case, he signaled they were likely to prevail in their claims.The judge told attorneys to file additional court papers in the case by Monday.""Let's go back to work!"" Acosta said outside the courthouse after the ruling.Trump has made his dislike of CNN clear since before he took office and continuing into his presidency. He has described the network as ""fake news"" both on Twitter and in public comments.At last week's press conference, which followed the midterm elections, Trump was taking questions from reporters and called on Acosta, who asked about Trump's statements about a caravan of migrants making its way to the U.S.-Mexico border. After a terse exchange, Trump told Acosta, ""That's enough,"" several times while calling on another reporter.Acosta attempted to ask another question about special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and initially declined to give up a hand-held microphone to a White House intern. Trump responded to Acosta by saying he wasn't concerned about the investigation, calling it a ""hoax,"" and then criticized Acosta, calling him a ""rude, terrible person.""The White House pulled Acosta's credentials hours later.The White House explanations for why it seized Acosta's credentials have shifted over the last week.Sanders initially explained the decision by accusing Acosta of making improper physical contact with the intern seeking to grab the microphone.But that rationale disappeared after witnesses backed Acosta's account that he was just trying to keep the microphone, and Sanders distributed a doctored video that made it appear Acosta was more aggressive than he actually was. On Tuesday, Sanders accused Acosta of being unprofessional by trying to dominate the questioning at the news conference."

11306224c026cc0715f3aa306fcf4ff3,"In what would seem a major win for India in its fight against cross-border terrorism, the United States has listed Pakistan among the nations and regions that provide ""safe havens"" to terrorists, saying terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad continue to operate, train, organise and fundraise inside the country in 2016. A report prepared by the US State Department said that although Pakistani military and security forces undertook operations against groups that conducted attacks within Pakistan but did not take sufficient action that threaten security of other countries like India. Reacting to the development, official sources in New Delhi said the US move is ""vindication"" of India's long-standing position on the menace of cross-border terrorism in its region. ""Pakistan did not take substantial action against the Afghan Taliban or Haqqani, or substantially limit their ability to threaten US interests in Afghanistan, although Pakistan supported efforts to bring both groups into an Afghan-led peace process,"" the State Department said in its annual 'Country Report on Terrorism'. ""Pakistan did not take sufficient action against other externally focused groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) in 2016, which continued to operate, train, organise, and fundraise in Pakistan,"" the report mandated by the Congress said. India, it said continued to experience attacks, ""including by Maoist insurgents and Pakistan-based terrorists"". Indian authorities continued to blame Pakistan for cross-border attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, it said. ""In January, India experienced a terrorist attack against an Indian military facility in Pathankot, Punjab, which was blamed by authorities on JeM. Over the course of 2016, the Government of India sought to deepen counterterrorism cooperation and information sharing with the United States,"" the State Department said. The Indian government continued to closely monitor the domestic threat from transnational terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), which made threats against India in their terrorist propaganda. A number of individuals were arrested for ISIS-affiliated recruitment and attack plotting within India, the report said. In a separate chapter, the State Department listed Pakistan as one of the safe havens of terrorism. The State Department said that numerous terrorist groups, including the Haqqani Network (HQN), the LeT and JeM continued to operate from Pakistani soil in 2016. ""Although LeT is banned in Pakistan, LeT's wings Jamaat- ud-Dawa (JuD) and Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation (FiF) were able to openly engage in fundraising, including in the capital,"" it said. ""LeT's chief Hafiz Saeed (a UN-designated terrorist) continued to address large rallies, although in February 2017, Pakistan proscribed him under relevant provisions of Schedule Four of the Anti-Terrorism Act, thus severely restricting his freedom of movement,"" it noted. The 2015 ban on media coverage of Saeed, JuD, and FiF continued and was generally followed by broadcast and print media, it said. The segments in South and Central Asia in the US State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2016 vindicate India's long-standing position on the menace of cross-border terrorism in our region, sources in New Delhi said. According to the State Department, the Pakistani government did not publicly reverse its December 2015 declaration that neither JuD nor FiF is banned in Pakistan, despite their listing under UN sanctions regimes, although in January 2017, Pakistan placed both organisations ""under observation"" pursuant to Schedule Two of the Anti-Terrorism Act. While not a ban, keeping the outfits under observation allows the government to closely scrutinise the activities of both organisations. On November 11, Pakistan's National Counterterrorism Authority published its own list of banned organisations that placed JuD in a separate section for groups that are ""under observation"" but not banned. Pakistan continued military operations to eradicate terrorist safe havens in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, although their impact on all terrorist groups was uneven, it said. In its report to the Congress, the State Department said in 2016, India and the United States pledged to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from groups including al-Qaeda, the ISIS, JeM, LeT and D-Company (Dawood Ibrahim's group), including through greater collaboration on designations at the UN. Indian and US leaders directed officials to identify new areas of collaboration through the July US-India Counterterrorism Joint Working Group, applauded finalisation of a bilateral arrangement to facilitate the sharing of terrorism screening information, and called upon Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of terrorist attacks against India to justice, the report said. The United States and India worked together to designate JeM leader Maulana Masood Azhar, although the listing was blocked in the UN 1267 Committee, the State Department said. Other areas mentioned in the report as safe havens are Afghanistan, Somalia, the Trans-Sahara, Sulu/Sulawesi Seas Littoral, Southern Philippines, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen, Columbia and Venezuela. (With PTI inputs)"

The jet took off from the airport earlier in the day, the start of three days of re-certification test flights that mark a step toward returning the aircraft to passenger service. The Federal Aviation Administration test flights over the next three days will evaluate Boeing's proposed changes to the automated flight control system on the MAX, a system that activated erroneously on two flights that crashed, killing 346 people.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has started Boeing 737 MAX recertification test flights, marking a major step towards the globally grounded aircraft's return to service.A 737 MAX aircraft departed from Boeing Field in Seattle on Monday morning for the first round of testing, said the FAA said in a statement, confirming that the administration and Boeing were conducting a series of certification flights this week to evaluate the airplane giant's proposed changes to the fleet's automated flight control system.The certification flights, which are expected to take approximately three days, will include a wide array of flight maneuvers and emergency procedures to assess whether the changes meet FAA certification standards, reports Xinhua news agency.The tests were being conducted by test pilots and engineers from the FAA and Boeing.""While the certification flights are an important milestone, a number of key tasks remain. The FAA is following a deliberate process and will take the time it needs to thoroughly review Boeing's work.""We will lift the grounding order only after we are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards,"" the FAA said.More than 800 737 MAX jets have been globally grounded since mid-March 2019 after investigators found flawed flight control software on the aircraft was partially responsible for two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people.This crisis has cost Boeing billions of dollars, including the compensation it must pay to victims and airlines.It also led to the dismissal of the company's CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, and raised questions about the trustworthiness of the company and FAA owing to the rush to approve and begin production of the Max.Boeing posted a net loss of $641 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared with $2.15 billion in profit in the same three-month period last year, as the COVID-19 pandemic and the worldwide grounding of its 737 MAX aircraft took a heavy toll on its business.The Chicago-based company has also announced that it plans to slash 10 per cent of its workforce and reduce the production of several of its commercial jet models, including the 737 MAX."
7674d7e65ff4f33e6cbcc04ce22d04cf,"Next year will be the greatest economic year in US history: Donald TrumpUS President Donald Trump has predicted that the American economy will soon recover from the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown and that the next year will be the greatest economic year in the country's history.Republican incumbent Trump faces a stiff challenge from the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, Joe biden, in the November 3 elections. The handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic condition and racial tensions have emerged as the main poll topics.“Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, that's what's going to happen,” Trump said at an election rally in Arizona, a battleground state, on Monday.The coronavirus has claimed 220,119 lives with over 8.2 million confirmed infections in the US. The pandemic has also resulted in one of the greatest recessions and job losses in the country's history.Of the 22 million jobs that were lost in early spring, 11 million jobs have been recovered. The budget deficit is at an all-time high of USD 3.1 trillion.Acknowledging that the country was reeling from the impact of the coronavirus, Trump promised his supporters that the country will soon get back to normal life.“That's what we want, just a normal. Just seven months ago (is where) we want to get back (to) and we will be better than that very soon, we build a foundation that (is) so strong and you see what's happening, (the) stock market (is going) through the roof,” he said.“We saved millions of lives by doing what we did and we built it (the economy) back up and it's a choice between the American dream or a socialist nightmare,” Trump said as he continued with his criticism of Biden and his running mate Senator Kamala Harris.“That's what it is. Biden will postpone the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools, and shut down our country and we are opening and we are opening rapidly and we've got a V (victory) shape. It may be a super V. It looks like it's a super V which nobody ever even heard of before,” he said.The president alleged that a Biden administration would massively raise taxes. “You will be buried in regulations. You know we cut regulations, it would take 18 to 21 years to get a highway approved, we have it down to one year and you know what from two to one very shortly to be exact,” he asserted.The Biden administration, he said, will bring all of those regulations back. “They want to dismantle your police departments,” he said.Trump alleged that Harris is a left liberal. “Biden even chose as his running mate the most liberal senator in America. Senator Kamala Harris is a sponsor of the socialist Green New Deal and legislation to strip away the private health plans of 180 million Americans,” he said.The Green New Deal is a Congressional resolution which aims to tackle factors contributing to global warming.“Harris also urged her supporters to donate to a fund that build out the rioters, the ones that knocked out your towns, your cities, not in Republican areas, by the way, all in Democrat areas,” Trump alleged, referring to the race protests after George Floyd's death in police custody.""Joe Biden is a servant of the left-wing globalists and lobbyists, the wealthy donors, the Washington vultures who got rich bleeding America dry. You know, they (Democrats) raise a lot of money. You know why? Because they make deals. They make deals,” he alleged.Trump said, if he wants, he can raise money for his campaign pretty soon and with ease.“I would be the greatest fundraiser in history if I wanted to call Wall Street. I know them all. 'I want USD 10 million for my campaign.' - 'Yes, sir.' All I have to say is I want USD 10 million, I want USD 15 million, I want USD 25 million. I would set every record,” he said.“In 2016, you voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment and you elected an outsider as president, who is finally putting America first. About time. It's about time. It's about time. Joe Biden is always and always has been a corrupt politician. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. And you know what? You knew that, a lot of people knew it for a long time,” he said.“And as far as I'm concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. And that's what it is. It's a criminal enterprise,” Trump said alleging that the mainstream media and the Big tech companies were trying to hide the entire corruption."

However, the procedure was delayed as Maryam was not allowed to travel.

""Journalists and media workers, in particular women, are facing heightened risks since the Taliban's political takeover of Afghanistan,"" United Nations Human Rights Special Procedures quoted UN experts as saying.The situation in Afghanistan has been deteriorating after the Taliban seized control of the war-ravaged country. On August 15, the Afghan government fell soon after President Ashraf Ghani left the country.""All governments must take strong and swift action to protect Afghan journalists who face persecution, including by expediting visas, assisting with evacuation and keeping their borders open for those who wish to leave Afghanistan,"" the experts said.Recalling the various resolutions on the safety of journalists adopted by the Human Rights Council in recent years, the UN experts called on the Council to uphold its own commitment and do more to address the growing threat to the safety of journalists in the country, reported United Nations Human Rights Special Procedures.""Reports of targeted killings of journalists and their family members, home raids, threats and intimidation in areas controlled by the Taliban have sharply increased in recent months.

14074cbe7ebfb8a8bae11d08f7b8da8b,"UNHRC: Pakistan demands lifting of communication blockade, release of Kashmiri leadersPakistan on Tuesday raked up the Kashmir issue at the UNHRC here and demanded the immediate lifting of the communication restrictions and release of all the political leaders and activists in the Valley, saying any ""inaction"" by the international community will only ""embolden"" India. Speaking at the 43rd session of the Human Rights Council which is being held here in Switzerland from February 24 to March 20, Pakistan's Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari alleged that India continues to violate the human rights of the Kashmiri people and demanded the immediate repeal of all actions by India on August 5 last year in Kashmir.India abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 on August 5 and bifurcated it into two Union territories. Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"". New Delhi has also asked Islamabad to accept the reality and stop its anti-India rhetoric.She alleged that ""over six thousand Kashmiri people, activists... were arrested without the due process of law"" and demanded their immediate release. The minister, known for her hardline anti-India stance, said any ""inaction"" by the international community and the Council will only ""embolden"" India to act with impunity.Mazari urged the UNHRC and the rest of the international community to take action against the alleged human rights atrocities and violations in Jammu and Kashmir. In her speech, she appealed the Council to constitute an independent Commission of Inquiry to investigate and report the alleged human rights violations in Kashmir as proposed in a UN report.In 2018, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) report recommended an independent, international Commission of Inquiry on Kashmir. Pakistan, she said is ready to facilitate the Commission of Inquiry to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and asked India to reciprocate in Jammu and Kashmir.Mazari outlined eight actions that, she said, the Council and the international community should take with respect to Jammu and Kashmir to protect the human rights situation in the Valley. She asked India to withdraw all the ""illegal actions"" of August 5, desist from changing demographics in Jammu and Kashmir and lift the lockdown and communications blackout there.The minister said India must ""allow"" the flow of medicines, food and other essential items to the Kashmiri people and release all ""arbitrarily detained"" Kashmiri leaders, professionals and activists, including young boys. Mazari demanded that India should repeal all the ""draconian laws"" which, she alleged, allowed the Indian security forces to ""commit atrocities"" in Kashmir and prohibit the use of force.She called for banning the use of pellet guns and ensure the drawdown of over 800,000 Indian troops in Jammu and Kashmir. The minister also highlighted the steps taken by her country to ensure the safety and security of the minority communities and mentioned the opening of the historic Kartarpur Sahib Corridor for the Sikhs.The Indian government abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5, 2019 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and imposed severe curbs including on movement of people as well as on mobile telephone and internet connectivity. The crackdown drew international criticism with several countries expressing concerns over the situation in Kashmir.India has categorically told the international community that its move to scrap Article 370 was an internal matter. According to officials, internet is being restored in the Valley in a phased manner after reviewing the security situation.ALSO READ | Qatar invites Pakistan to attend signing of US-Taliban peace deal ALSO READ | Punjab govt not to extend bail granted to Nawaz Sharif to treatment abroad"

But the search for the source has led to tensions, notably with the US.President Donald Trump's administration has accused China of trying to conceal the initial outbreak.Leendertz said the aim was to find out when the virus began circulating and whether or not it originated in Wuhan.The mission was expected to last four or five weeks, he added.Research suggests that coronaviruses capable of infecting humans may have been circulating undetected in bats for decades.Last December, a Chinese doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital - Li Wenliang - tried to warn fellow medics about a possible outbreak of a new disease, but was told by police to ""stop making false comments"" and was investigated for ""spreading rumours"".Li died in February after contracting the virus while treating patients in the city.ALSO READ | Chinese study which claimed COVID-19 originated in India withdrawn"

The country, with a population of about 70 million, has ordered some 400 million doses of vaccines.

In the recently concluded FATF meeting in Paris, Pakistan was not removed from the FATF grey list on the grounds that the country did not comply with the FATF standards. This new development in Geneva reiterates the fact that Imran Khan's government in Pakistan has been following the policies of its predecessors of not walking the talk when it comes to dismantling the terror camps that operate on its soil. On his recent trip to India, US President Donald  Trump has also said that the US government was working closely with Pakistan to dismantle the terror camps that have been allowed to breed freely from the soil of India's western neighbor.    /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

The palace says the husband of Queen Elizabeth II was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital on the evening of Tuesday Feb. 16, 2021.Britain’s 99-year-old Prince Philip has been admitted to a London hospital after feeling unwell, Buckingham Palace said Wednesday. The palace said the husband of Queen Elizabeth II was admitted to the private King Edward VII Hospital on Tuesday evening.It called the admission “a precautionary measure” taken on the advice of Philip’s doctor. The palace said Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, is expected to remain for a few days of “observation and rest.”His illness is not believed to be related to COVID-19. The queen and Philip received a first dose of a vaccine against the coronavirus in early January.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office said he “sends his best wishes to the Duke of Edinburgh as he undergoes a few days of rest in hospital.”Philip retired from public duties in 2017 and rarely appears in public. His most recent public event was a military ceremony at Buckingham Palace in July.ALSO READ | London schools to stay closed amid COVID-19 infection surgeDuring England’s current coronavirus lockdown, the duke has been staying at Windsor Castle, west of London, with the queen, who has performed duties such as meetings with dignitaries remotely.Lockdown permitting, the royal household is planning celebrations, to mark Philip’s 100th birthday on June 10.Philip married the then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947 and is the longest-serving royal consort in British history. He and the queen have four children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.A former naval officer and keen polo player, Philip enjoyed robust health well into old age but has had a number of health issues in recent years.In 2011, he was rushed to a hospital by helicopter after suffering chest pains and treated for a blocked coronary artery. In 2017, he spent two nights in the King Edward VII hospital and was hospitalized for 10 days in 2018 for a hip replacement.Philip was last hospitalized in December 2019, spending four nights in the King Edward VII Hospital for what the palace said was planned treatment of a pre-existing condition.He was forced to give up driving at the age of 97, after smashing into a car while driving a Land Rover near Sandringham estate in January 2019. Philip needed help to get out of the Land Rover but wasn’t injured. A woman in the other vehicle suffered a broken wrist.Even after that, Philip continued to drive a horse and carriage on private land from time to time."
848e39cdd754cb1f68595df9afce6213,"Prolonged air pollution exposure doubles risk of smell loss: Study Long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) 2.5 -- a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air- doubles the risk of losing smell, a hallmark of Covid-19, according to a study.The loss of smell, a condition known as anosmia, can severely impact a person's quality of life, making it extremely difficult to taste foods, detect airborne hazards in the environment, and carry out other functions dependent on the senses.Covid-19 has further thrust olfaction into the spotlight as olfactory disturbances appear to be both a cardinal symptom and, in some cases, a debilitating consequence of the ongoing global pandemic, said researchers from the Johns Hopkins University in the US.While previous research has associated PM2.5 as a likely culprit for anosmia, the team from Johns Hopkins conducted a new study to better understand how long-term exposure to air pollution can rob someone of the ability to smell and taste.They found long-term airborne exposure to PM2.5 increases the risk of losing one's smell by nearly twice (a 1.6- to 1.7-fold increase).This may occur because the location of the olfactory nerve, which contains the sensory nerve fibres relating to the sense of smell, places it directly in the path of inhaled PM2.5 materials. The findings appeared in the JAMA Network Open.""Based on this result, we feel that long-term exposure to high levels of PM2.5 represents a common risk factor for the loss of sense of smell, especially in vulnerable populations such as older people -- but also one that is potentially modifiable if sources of PM2.5 components can be better controlled,"" said lead author Murugappan Ramanathan, rhinologist and associate professor of otolaryngology -- head and neck surgery at the University's School of Medicine.In their study, the researchers looked at 2,690 people, aged 18 and older, who were evaluated by otolaryngologists between January 2013 and December 2016. Of these, 538 were diagnosed with anosmia, with an average age of 54 and with men making up the majority (339 or 63 per cent).Exposure to PM2.5 has been already linked to cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, decline in cognitive thinking ability, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and premature death."

Action will be taken,” Shanmugam wrote.The police said on Wednesday they will not condone acts that threaten racial and religious harmony in Singapore.“Any person who makes remarks that can cause ill-will and hostility between the different races and religions will be dealt with swiftly and firmly,"" the police said."

The first 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries with a US master's degree or higher are exempt from the cap.Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.“We recently determined that we needed to select additional registrations to reach the Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 numerical allocations. On July 28, we selected previously submitted electronic registrations using a random selection process,” the USCIS said in a statement.“The petition filing period based on registrations selected on July 28 will begin on August 2 and close on November 3. Individuals with selected registrations will have their myUSCIS accounts updated to include a selection notice, which includes details of when and where to file,” it said.The move by the USCIS to conduct the second lottery will provide another chance to several applicants, including hundreds of Indian IT professionals, who could not make it in the first random selection.The federal agency said that only those petitioners with selected registrations for FY 2022 are eligible to file H-1B cap-subject petitions.The initial filing period for those with selected registrations for FY 2022 was from April 1, 2021, through June 30, 2021.The USCIS said an H-1B cap-subject petition must be properly filed at the correct service centre and within the filing period indicated on the relevant registration selection notice.Online filing is not available for H-1B petitions. Petitioners filing H-1B petitions must do so by paper and must include a printed copy of the applicable registration selection notice with the FY 2022 H-1B cap-subject petition.“Registration selection only indicates that petitioners are eligible to file H-1B cap-subject petitions; it does not indicate that the petition will be approved,"" the USCIS said.""Petitioners filing H-1B cap-subject petitions, including those petitions eligible for the advanced degree exemption, must still submit evidence and establish eligibility for petition approval based on existing statutory and regulatory requirements,” the USCIS added."

He belonged to an organisation named People's League in Anantnag.The chargesheet further alleged that ""Shah claimed that these calls were made from Pakistan to discuss the Kashmir issue"".""Shah admitted that Shayar used to talk to Shah and not to his family for the last 18 to 20 years. Shayar also calls Shah through Zamir Ahmed Sheikh, the photographer, driver and close aide of Shah on his mobile number 9469100898,"" the ED claimed.The ED also said that Shah's Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party website's IP address belongs to Peshawar in Pakistan and is hosted on host201212.comhosting.com and the organisation of the domain is Commission on Science and Technology at Peshawar, Pakistan North West Province.Shah was arrested by the ED on July 25 in a money laundering case of 2005.

While five kids were from South Korea, remaining six were Chinese nationals. All were aged between three and 6 years.News agency Xinhua reported that the driver had set the bus on fire because he was angry about overtime and cut in night-shift pay.“The driver’s overtime and night shift allowance had been suspended, angering him, causing him to buy gasoline to set the fire,” it said citing provincial police.“The fire was started on the bus floor near the driver’s seat. A lighter cap was discovered nearby and gasoline residue found on multiple spots on the bus.

The study, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology on Thursday, provides the first data to show that cortisol levels are a marker of the severity of the illness.The researchers, led by Professor Waljit Dhillo from Imperial College London in the UK, suggest they can be used to identify those patients who are more likely to need intensive cover.Cortisol is produced by the body in response to stress such as illness, triggering changes in metabolism, heart function and the immune system to help our bodies cope, the researchers said.Our cortisol levels when healthy and resting are 100-200 nm/L and nearly zero when we sleep.When ill patients have low levels of cortisol, it can be life threatening, they said.According to the researchers, excessive levels of cortisol during illness can be equally dangerous, leading to increased risk of infection and poor outcomes.In the new observational study of 535 patients, of whom 403 were confirmed to have COVID-19, cortisol levels in patients with COVID-19 were significantly higher than in those without.The levels in the COVID-19 group ranged as high as 3241 --considerably higher even than after major surgery, when levels can top 1000, the researchers said.Amongst the COVID-19 patients, those with a baseline cortisol level of 744 or less survived on average for 36 days.Patients with levels over 744 had an average survival of just 15 days.""From an endocrinologist's perspective, it makes sense that those COVID-19 patients who are the sickest will have higher levels of cortisol, but these levels are worryingly high,"" said Dhillo, Head of Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism at Imperial College London.""Having an early indicator of which patients may deteriorate more quickly will help us with providing the best level of care as quickly as possible, as well as helping manage the pressure on the NHS,"" he said.In addition, he said medical professionals can also take cortisol levels into account when we are working out how best to treat our patients.In the study, COVID-19 swab test and routine blood tests -- including a baseline measurement of cortisol levels -- were performed within 48 hours of admission.Over the study period, just under 27 per cent of the COVID-19 group died during the study period compared to just under 7 per cent of the non-COVID-19 group, the researchers said."

The mudslide in the city of Unzen in Nagasaki prefecture hit two houses with four residents total. A woman in her 50s was pronounced dead, while a man in his 60s was seriously injured, according to Unzen city officials. Rescue workers were searching for the two other residents.The Japan Meteorological Agency issued heavy rain and mudslide warnings in parts of the southern main island of Kyushu. Earlier warnings for Hiroshima in western Japan, where record rainfall fell earlier this week, were downgraded as rains subsided.Television footage on NHK public broadcaster showed rivers swollen with muddy water gushing down, almost overflowing, in Hiroshima.The meteorological agency said nearly 500 millimeters (20 inches) of rain fell in parts of Nagasaki in the past 48 hours, exceeding the average for the month of August. More downpours were forecast.Local authorities issued evacuation advisories to high-risk areas in those regions, affecting more than 3 million residents, but the measure is non-compulsory and a fraction usually evacuates.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called a disaster management meeting and pledged to do the utmost for the rescue and relief operation and support for the affected residents."

Sri Lanka's police say they have either killed or arrested all those responsible for the bombings.Sri Lanka has a population of 21 million which is a patchwork of ethnicities and religions, dominated by the Sinhalese Buddhist majority.Muslims account for 10 per cent of the population and are the second-largest minority after Hindus. Around seven per cent of Sri Lankans are Christians. On Monday, the Sri Lankan government enforced a countrywide curfew and blocked social media platforms to stop people inciting violence as communal violence spread to new areas in the island nation in the worst unrest since Easter Sunday bombings.Police also fired tear gas at mobs attacking mosques and shops owned by Muslims in various parts of the country. Meanwhile, Sirisena has also prohibited the use of drones in the country till further notice. ""The navigation of any unmanned aircraft or drone in or over the territory of Sri Lanka by any person other than a member of Triforces or police is prohibited until further notice,"" another Gazette notification said.Earlier, Sri Lankan Civil Aviation Authority banned the use of drone and unmanned aircraft following the devastating terror attack on Easter Sunday."

He also took responsibility on behalf of his militant group for shooting Malala Yousafzai in Swat Valley in 2012.After blanking out NYT article on “Chechnya’s anti-gay pogrom” on Thursday, May 4, this is the second-time Express Tribune has done it.It clarified the decision to censor Hanif's article saying NYT had ""no role in its removal"".""While we understand that our publishing partners are sometimes faced with local pressures, we regret and condemn any censorship of our journalism,"" a spokeswoman for NYT told the AFP news agency.The online version of the article, however, was trending in Pakistan by afternoon.

47c0e7b0f1364b827cf8a6450aad1b72,"The Volcano of Fire continues to spew huge clouds of ash, in San Miguel Los Lotes, Guatemala. Guatemalan authorities ordered new evacuations Friday due to activity at the Volcano of Fire.  Forensic experts worked June 8, on the grim task of identifying dozens of bodies charred beyond recognition by the eruption of Guatemala’s Volcano of Fire, a disaster that has left at least 110 confirmed dead and nearly 200 still missing.Even as search and recovery efforts were suspended for a second day amid dangerous new volcanic flows and dwindling hopes of finding survivors, about 15 forensic experts worked at a makeshift morgue in a warehouse in the southern city of Escuintla.Related Stories ‘Nobody is left’: Guatemala volcano wipes out entire familiesGuatemala town destroyed by volcano thought it was safe; death toll reaches 109, over 200 missingThe corpses arrive wrapped in sheets and plastic, blackened and often missing extremities, filling the cavernous, metal-roofed warehouse with the unmistakable stench of death. Some still had hair; others did not.First, the experts check for anything that could help identify the bodies, such as clothing that hasn’t been burned off by flows said to have reached temperatures as high as 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit (700 C).Later, they will take genetic material from the bones — the only option available — and compare it to blood drawn from people with missing relatives. The bones can also yield information to help determine age and gender.“We are extracting the samples from bones to do DNA tests,” said forensic expert Miguel Morales, which was allowed access to the morgue to witness the work. “The tissues are in very bad shape.”Morales said the bodies were essentially mummified, cooked by the extreme heat.On one table lay the body of someone frozen statue-like in death, the stomach distended and a hand jutting stiffly outward. A woman took notes, and another worker took photographs.Dozens more bodies were shrouded in white plastic on wooden pallets, and workers used fans and dry ice to cool the space. In all, there were about 40 corpses.At one end of the cinderblock warehouse, dozens of coffins lay waiting to receive identified bodies that would be handed over to relatives and quickly buried as mandated by health authorities.Image Source : APDrone footage shot on Tuesday showed the town of El Rodeo in a lifeless state. Houses and trees were covered with thick coat of grey soot as rescue workers were seen on site. Drone footage shot on Tuesday showed the town of El Rodeo in a lifeless state. Houses and trees were covered with thick coat of grey soot as rescue workers were seen on site. National Institute of Forensic Sciences director Fanuel Garcia Morales said the process can take several days and workers are trying to get the dead to their families as quickly as possible.“The (bodies) are essentially petrified. It’s really a question of that in touching and extracting them (during the recovery), they can fall apart easily,” Garcia said.Dr. Carlos Rodas, head of operations at the temporary morgue, said workers were employing a variety of techniques including examination of fingerprints, when available, dentistry and individual characteristics such as birthmarks, scars, tattoos and previously broken bones.Authorities ordered new evacuations Friday, warning of activity at the Volcano of Fire and saying dangerous flows of volcanic material, water and sediment were coursing through four canyons. Late Friday, authorities raised the death toll by one to 110.Residents of the town of El Rodeo, who had recently returned to their homes, were told to leave once again, and people were warned to avoid canyons and areas close to the volcano.Disaster agency Conred said more than 3,000 workers were attending to families affected by the eruption, and about 3,700 displaced people were being housed in shelters.Officials say on-and-off downpours have destabilised the terrain and made it too dangerous to work.But people with missing loved ones have been upset by the suspension of search and recovery efforts. Some criticized the government’s response and travelled into the disaster zones to search for loved ones themselves, digging with their hands or whatever tools they could get a hold of.Estuardo Hernandez, 19, was talking by phone to his father, Margarito Hernandez, when millions of tons of ash tore through the village of San Miguel Los Lotes on the volcano’s slope.“He called me at 3:13 p.m. Sunday,” said Hernandez, who was working in the nearby city of Antigua that day and escaped the deadly flow. “The last thing he told me was to go far from here. ... The last thing I could hear was him saying: ‘Get inside! There’s a lot of fire out there.’ I say they stayed in the house.”Peering into the ash-filled home, Hernandez pointed at the back wall where he believes his parents tried to seek refuge.In the days since the disaster, he said, no government official had come by to take down information or lend a hand, even as crews used earth-moving equipment not far away to clear a stretch of blocked highway.“Without help we can’t do anything ... the only thing that matters to the government is the highway,” Hernandez said. “Why not bring machinery in here?”"
b26e0fefda0d91438f97ee8966e4adc4,"LeT, Jaish continue to be threat to India; Pak allowed terror activists to contests polls: USSaudi Arabia formally started the long-anticipated initial public offering of its state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco on Sunday, which will see a sliver of the firm offered on a local stock exchange in hopes of raising billions of dollars for the kingdom.An announcement from the kingdom’s Capital Market Authority announcing its approval for the share sale served as a starting gun for an IPO promised by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman since 2016.The firm’s shares will be traded on Riyadh’s Tadawul stock exchange, said Amin H. Nasser, the president and CEO of Aramco, in an online video. Plans call for the firm to put other shares on a foreign exchange in the future.“This is transformational and historic moment for Saudi Aramco,” Nasser said. He also stressed Aramco’s “disciplined financial approach and prudent and flexible balance sheet.”Prince Mohammed hopes for a very-optimistic $2 trillion valuation for Aramco, which produces 10 million barrels of crude oil a day and provides some 10% of global demand. That would raise the $100 billion he needs for his ambitious redevelopment plans for a Saudi Arabia hoping for new jobs, as unemployment stands at over 10%.However, economic worries, the trade war between China and the U.S. and increased crude oil production by the U.S. has depressed energy prices. A Sept. 14 attack on the heart of Aramco already spooked some investors, with one ratings company already downgrading the oil giant.The announcement by the Capital Market Authority offered no timeline for the IPO, nor did documents later released by Aramco.“The Capital Market Authority board has issued its resolution approving the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. application for the registration and offering of part of its shares,” the authority said in its statement. “The company’s prospectus will be published prior to the start of the subscription period.”The Saudi-owned satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported last week, citing anonymous sources, that pricing for the stock will begin Nov. 17. A final price for the stock will be set Dec. 4, with shares then beginning to be traded on the Tadawul on Dec. 11, the channel reported. The channel is believed to have close links to the kingdom’s Al Saud royal family.Aramco in its IPO documentation said the percentage of the company offered and the share price “will be determined at the end of the book-building period.” It said Aramco had a net income of $111.1 billion in 2018 and proven liquid reserves of 226.8 billion barrels. It said its net income as of the end of the third quarter this year was $68 billion.Shares will be offered to institutional investors, as well as individual Saudi and foreign investors.The kingdom has in the past used the company as a piggy bank for development companies, back when it was still an American company. Since buying a 100% interest in the firm by 1980, the royal family as its sole “shareholder” largely hasn’t interfered in the company’s long-term business decisions as its revenue provides around 60% of all government revenue.But recently, there have been decisions seemingly forced onto Aramco, including the nearly $70 billion purchase in March of the petrochemical firm Saudi Basic Industries Corp. just before SABIC announced a plunge in its quarterly profits.In Aramco’s first-ever half-year results, it reported income of $46.8 billion. Yet analysts say a $2 trillion valuation — Apple and Microsoft separately for instance are $1 trillion — may be a stretch. By announcing the start of the IPO on Sunday, Prince Mohammed may have been convinced to take a lower valuation in order to get the IPO moving. The kingdom likely is pinning its hopes on tremendous local interest to push up the company’s valuation before potentially taking some of the stock abroad.Analysts believe Aramco will list as much as 3% of the firm on the Tadawul, with another 2% put abroad.Saudi Aramco has sought to assure investors, given the questions over its valuation and the potential hazards of future attacks or geopolitical risk. A presentation posted to Aramco’s website last month announced the intent to offer a $75 billion dividend for investors in 2020. That’s the payment per share that a corporation distributes to its stockholders as their return on the money they have invested in its stock.It also pledged that some 2020 through 2024, any year with a dividend under $75 billion would see “non-government shareholders” prioritized to get paid.But beyond the stocks, worries persist that Saudi Arabia could be hit by another attack like the one Sept. 14, which the U.S. blames on Iran. Iran denies it launched the cruise missiles and drones used in the attack. Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility, but analysts say the weapons used wouldn’t have the range to reach their targets from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.Responding to a journalist’s question about the safety of an Aramco investment, the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund governor Yasir al-Rumayyan spoke about how quickly the company restored production after the attack.“The oil traders, they saw this as a nonevent, and that means it is really safe,” he said. “That’s what the money is saying.”"
a29380e6cf6d82250ef11911777b649a,"US will make sure other countries know that coronavirus originated in China: PompeoThe United States is working with other countries to make sure they understand that coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said. Stressing that the burden is on Beijing to explain where the virus came from, Pompeo told The Ben Shapiro Show in an interview on Friday that China knew about the virus by December, 2019.“We need to hold accountable the parties responsible for the deaths here in the United States and the enormous economic costs that have been posed on the US,” he said. Pompeo said that the entire global economic system has been decimated. ""Diplomatically, we're reaching out to countries all across the world to help them do the right thing, to help their economies get started back up, to make sure that when the time is right we can get international travel kicked back up so that global commerce can recommence, he said.“If you get demand back up, that will matter an awful lot to workers right here in the United States of America,” he said. “We are also working with those countries to make sure they understand that this was in fact a virus that originated in Wuhan, China, that the Chinese government knew about this certainly by December of 2019,"" he said. ""... and that they (China) failed to comply with their most fundamental obligations as a nation, and importantly, too, failed to comply with the international health regulations of the World Health Organization and then did a lot of things – and we can talk about them at great length – to cover that up,” Pompeo added. Those are the kinds of things that the US needs to address, he said.Pompeo alleged that the World Health Organization failed in its mission to protect the world from the pandemic. “We’re not going to let that happen again, and we’re going to set up something, a system, which delivers an outcome which reduces the risk that anything like this can ever happen again, from China or from anyplace else,” he said. Responding to a question, Pompeo said that even the world’s largest businesses now can see the political risk associated with operating in China.“When the Chinese Communist Party refuses to uphold basic norms of transparency, basic set of functions that preserve human rights, and the things that need to happen just to make sure the globe doesn’t end up in crises like – I think out of their own economic interest they’re going to make very different decisions going forward. I think that’s completely appropriate for them to evaluate that,” he said.Meanwhile, in an interview to NPR, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said that the “burden is on the Chinese to explain where the virus came from. But there is a lab in Wuhan that deals with this sort of virus. And we need to know if there was some sort of release. Accidental, perhaps.""""We don't know where the virus came from. Maybe it came from a wet market in Wuhan. Maybe it came from one of the two virology labs in Wuhan,” O’Brien said. In a statement, Congressman Jeff Van Drew called out China’s government for their role in the ""death, destruction and dereliction"" of human decency in their behaviour over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak.“Every American of every background and creed should be furious with China for their disregard of human well-being amidst the Coronavirus cover-up they have participated in,"" he said. ""Had we known sooner, or had the Chinese government been honest, we would not be in the position we are today,” he said.“We have relied on China for far too long to provide cheap labour and goods at the expense of America and our workers. We must bring that supply-chain home and end the export gap we have; It's time to hold China accountable for their actions,” Drew said. Congressman Michael Waltz on Friday introduced a legislation in the House of Representatives that would ban members of the US military and federal employees from funding China’s People’s Liberation Army through their federal retirement plans.“It is absolutely crazy for our military and federal employees to be indirectly contributing to China’s military operations – and what’s worse is that nearly all of these people are completely unaware of this situation,” Waltz said. Congressman Waltz’s bill would ban the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) – all five of whom were appointed by President Barack Obama – from steering military and federal employees’ retirement contributions to China.Every month, a combined 5.6 million US military members and federal employees contribute to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), a 401K-style plan taken out of their paychecks. The TSP, which is administered by the FRTIB, is responsible for over USD700 billion in assets, making it one of the world’s largest retirement funds."
deeeca1768b6183fc49f4ec560e9cb3a,"Two paratroopers assigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division conduct security during evacuation operation in Kabul, AfghanistanActing swiftly on US President Joe Biden’s promise to retaliate for the deadly suicide bombing at Kabul airport, the US military said it used a drone strike to kill a member of the Islamic State group’s Afghanistan affiliate Saturday. The strike came amid what the White House called indications that the IS planned to strike again as the US-led evacuation from Kabul airport moved into its final days. Biden has set Tuesday as his deadline for completing the exit.Biden authorized the drone strike and it was ordered by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, a defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details not yet publicly announced.The airstrike was launched from beyond Afghanistan less than 48 hours after the devastating Kabul attack that killed 13 Americans and scores of Afghans with just days left in a final US withdrawal after 20 years of war. US Central Command provided few details; it said it believed its strike killed no civilians.The speed with which the US military retaliated reflected its close monitoring of IS and years of experience in targeting extremists in remote parts of the world. But it also shows the limits of US power to eliminate extremist threats, which some believe will have more freedom of movement in Afghanistan now that the Taliban is in power.Central Command said the drone strike was conducted in Nangahar province against an IS member believed to be involved in planning attacks against the United States in Kabul. The strike killed one individual, spokesman Navy Capt. William Urban said.It wasn’t clear if the targeted individual was involved directly in the Thursday suicide blast outside the gates of the Kabul airport, where crowds of Afghans were desperately trying to get in as part of the ongoing evacuation.The airstrike came after Biden declared Thursday that perpetrators of the attack would not be able to hide.“We will hunt you down and make you pay,” he said. Pentagon leaders told reporters Friday that they were prepared for whatever retaliatory action the president ordered.“We have options there right now,” said Maj. Gen. Hank Taylor of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff.The president was warned Friday to expect another lethal attack in the closing days of a frantic US-led evacuation. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden’s national security team offered a grim outlook. “They advised the president and vice president that another terror attack in Kabul is likely, but that they are taking maximum force protection measures at the Kabul airport,” Psaki said, echoing what the Pentagon has been saying since the bombing Thursday at Kabul airport.US tells citizens to leave Kabul airport gates 'immediately'Following the Kabul airport blast, the US Embassy in Kabul on Thursday (local time) warned its citizens to stay away from the Kabul airport and told anyone outside the perimeter to ""leave immediately,"" citing unnamed security threats. The US Embassy cited three areas of particular concern in its advisory. ""US citizens who are at the Abbey Gate, East Gate, or North Gate now should leave immediately,"" the statement said, without further detail, media reports said.A senior US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about confidential assessments, confirmed that the United States was tracking a ""specific"" and ""credible"" threat at the airport from the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, which has carried out dozens of attacks in recent years, many targeting ethnic minorities and other civilians.The warnings came as the last of the estimated 1,500 Americans and countless other foreigners still in Afghanistan try to make it to the airport to leave before the Taliban deadline of August 31, reported The New York Times.The US government has been warning about potential security threats at the airport, and access to the airport has been adjusted accordingly, with some gates temporarily closed.Earlier, the British and Australian governments issued similar warnings, with Australian officials describing ""an ongoing and very high threat of terrorist attack.""Marise Payne, Australia's Foreign Minister, said at a news conference Thursday that the Taliban will allow Australian citizens and visa holders to leave safely but added, ""Our travel advice remains: You should not come to Hamid Karzai airport because it is not safe to do so, and if you are in Kabul, you should shelter in place, move to a safe location and await further advice.""Thousands of Afghan nationals are camped outside the perimeter of the airport in desperate attempts to escape on the last flights out after the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. US statement on Kabul airport attackFew new details about the airport attack emerged a day later, but the Pentagon corrected its initial report that there had been suicide bombings at two locations. It said there was just one — at or near the Abbey Gate — followed by gunfire. The initial report of a second bombing at the nearby Baron Hotel proved to be false, said Maj. Gen. Hank Taylor of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff; he attributed the mistake to initial confusion.Based on a preliminary assessment, US officials believe the suicide vest used in the attack, which killed at least 169 Afghans in addition to the 13 Americans, carried about 25 pounds of explosives and was loaded with shrapnel, a U.S. official said Friday. A suicide bomb typically carries five to 10 pounds of explosives, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss preliminary assessments of the bombing.Biden still faces the problem over the longer term of containing an array of potential extremist threats based in Afghanistan, which will be harder with fewer U.S. intelligence assets and no military presence in the nation.Emily Harding, a former CIA analyst and deputy staff director for the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she doubted Biden’s assurances that the United States will be able to monitor and strike terror threats from beyond Afghanistan’s borders. The Pentagon also insists this so-called “over the horizon” capability, which includes surveillance and strike aircraft based in the Persian Gulf area, will be effective.In an Oval Office appearance Friday, Biden again expressed his condolences to victims of the attack. The return home of U.S. military members’ remains in the coming days will provide painful and poignant reminders not just of the devastation at the Kabul airport but also of the costly way the war is ending. More than 2,400 U.S. service members died in the war and tens of thousands were injured over the past two decades.The Marine Corps said 11 of the 13 Americans killed were Marines. One was a Navy sailor and one an Army soldier. Their names have not been released pending notification of their families, a sometimes-lengthy process that Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said involves “difficult conversations.”Still, sorrowful details of those killed were starting to emerge. One Marine from Wyoming was on his first tour in Afghanistan and his wife is expecting a baby in three weeks; another was a 20-year-old man from Missouri whose father was devastated by the loss. A third, a 20-year-old from Texas, had joined the armed services out of high school.Biden ordered U.S. flags to half-staff across the country in honor of the 13.They were the first U.S. service members killed in Afghanistan since February 2020, the month the Trump administration struck an agreement with the Taliban that called for the militant group to halt attacks on Americans in exchange for a U.S. agreement to remove all American troops and contractors by May 2021. Biden announced in April that he would have all forces out by September.Psaki said the next few days of the mission to evacuate Americans and others, including vulnerable Afghans fleeing Taliban rule, “will be the most dangerous period to date.”The White House said that as of Friday morning, about 12,500 people were airlifted from Kabul in the last 24 hours on U.S. and coalition aircraft; in the 12 hours that followed, another 4,200 people were evacuated. Psaki said about 300 Americans had departed and the State Department was working with about 500 more who want to leave. The administration has said it intends to push on and complete the airlift despite the terror threats.Kirby told reporters the U.S. military is monitoring credible, specific Islamic State threats “in real time.”“We certainly are prepared and would expect future attempts,” Kirby said. He declined to describe details of any additional security measures being taken, including those implemented by the Taliban, around the airport gates and perimeter.

She blasted Brexit in her speech, held the top rate of income tax at 46 per cent - six per cent higher than the rest of the UK - and announced £1.8billion on projects to tackle climate change.MSP Forbes only found out that she would announce the budget for the coming year at around 8am today - just after Derek Mackay resigned in disgrace. She had already made history when she was made public finance and digital economy minister in 2018, by becoming the first government minister who was born in the same decade that the parliament was created.After setting out the budget, she sat down next to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who patted her on the arm as the room applauded.Since becoming a minister, Forbes  has worked with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, whom she was close to, prior to his fall from grace today over claims he sent messages to a 16-year-old boy.His resignation will dramatically cut short Mr Mackay’s own rise to the top of Scottish politics, but could accelerate the ascent of Forbes in the process. "

54a8e257b3c5009ecf8c989ceea22236,"Amid a shortage of masks, the U.S. is sticking with that advice but Tuesday, President Donald Trump suggested people who are worried wear a scarf.If you’re not sick with the new coronavirus, should you wear a mask in public? Global health authorities say no. Amid a shortage of masks, the U.S. is sticking with that advice but Tuesday, President Donald Trump suggested people who are worried wear a scarf.That shortage is so severe that the Joint Commission, which accredits U.S. hospitals, said Tuesday that if facilities can’t provide proper masks, health workers are allowed to bring their own from home.Front-line health workers have the greatest need for masks. And when people are sick, wearing a mask helps lessen the chances of infecting others. In places where relatives care for the sick at home, the World Health Organization also has recommended they wear a mask.But “there is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any particular benefit,” Dr. Mike Ryan, the WHO’s epidemics chief, told reporters Monday.“In fact, there’s some evidence to suggest the opposite,” he added, noting risks from an improperly fitted mask or touching the face while taking it off or putting it on.For months as the COVID-19 crisis grew and masks disappeared from store shelves, U.S. health officials have agreed. The virus is believed to spread mostly through droplets from coughs or sneezes, and thus the main advice has been to keep your distance — staying 6 feet away — in addition to frequent hand-washing and not touching your face. Health workers who may be doing procedures that generate tinier particles are supposed to get high priority for tight-fitting filtering masks.“Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS!” Surgeon General Jerome Adams wrote in a February 29 tweet. “They are not effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk.”But mask-wearing has long been common in some countries during respiratory outbreaks, especially in parts of Asia. As questions grow about whether people sometimes can spread the virus before realizing they’re sick -- which social distancing is supposed to address — increasingly people ask what it would hurt to wear some form of mask in public.Trump said Tuesday that his scientific advisers made clear the general public shouldn’t be competing with hospitals and health workers for scarce masks of any type.His solution: “Use a scarf if you want,” Trump said at the daily White House briefing. “It doesn’t have to be a mask. It’s not a bad idea at least for a period of time.”Earlier in the day, Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, had told CNN that once there are enough masks, there might be “some very serious consideration” about broadening the mask recommendations.For now, the advice posted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website: “If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a face mask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a face mask).”"

Ky, the sources said, also told the FAA officials he will need extra time to inform and gain support from European legislators and national aviation authorities within the EU.An EASA spokeswoman declined to comment on the European-US rupture, except to say ""we would like to see the MAX return to service as soon as possible, but only once we are confident it is safe"".An FAA spokesman said the agency, which hasn't set a deadline for getting the fleet back in the air, ""has a transparent and collaborative relationship with other civil-aviation authorities"".The spokesman also said ""each government will make its own decision to return the aircraft to service based on a thorough safety assessment"".A Boeing spokesman said it is cooperating with the FAA-led effort, but ""each of the regulators will determine on their own timeline when they will certify the MAX"".The revelations are the latest for the commercial aerospace giant, which was forced to ground the MAX in March due to safety concerns. They also mean more uncertainty for Boeing shareholders, who are keenly focused on when the MAX might return to service.The 737 MAX has been globally grounded since March, as investigators evaluate the airplane's safety following the fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which claimed the lives of 346 people.ALSO READ | DGCA to inspect 23 Boeing 737 planes of SpiceJet for possible cracksALSO READ | Boeing to pay kin of victims killed in 737 MAX crashes"

ae6cd76ee1469a66cef50362eddf006c,"RedHill's oral pill shows promise against Covid-related pneumonia (Representational Image)Israel-based biopharmaceutical company RedHill Biopharma's new oral pill called Opaganib has been found effective in patients hospitalised with Covid-related pneumonia, results from a clinical trial has shown.The oral opaganib is associated with a reduction in the need for supplemental oxygen support, earlier time to discharge from hospital and was well tolerated, the company said in a statement on Monday.The Phase II trial analysed data from the 40-patient who were randomised to receive either opaganib or placebo in addition to standard of care (SoC), predominantly including dexamethasone and/or remdesivir.About 86.4 per cent of patients treated with opaganib were discharged from hospital by Day 14 compared to 55.6 per cent of patients treated with placebo. The findings were presented at the World Microbe Forum, taking place online from June 20 to 24.""Presentation of these positive data from our exploratory Phase 2 study support our growing confidence that opaganib could be the first novel oral therapy to demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of Covid-19 in a large late-stage study. With the recent completion of enrollment of our 475-patient global Phase 2/3 study, we will have a clearer picture of that in the very near future,"" said Mark L Levitt, Medical Director at RedHill.""Opaganib acts on both the cause and effect of Covid-19 via a unique dual antiviral and anti-inflammatory mode of action. Being host-targeted, opaganib is also expected to maintain effect against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, which continue to threaten the progress being made against the pandemic and underscore the urgent need for effective Covid-19 therapeutics,"" Levitt added.Opaganib is orally-administered and has a sphingosine kinase-2 (SK2) selective inhibitor, with dual anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity. It targets the host and is therefore expected to be effective against emerging viral variants. Opaganib has also shown anticancer activity and has the potential to target multiple oncology, viral, inflammatory, and gastrointestinal indications.Opaganib demonstrated potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, completely inhibiting viral replication in an in vitro model of human lung bronchial tissue.Additionally, preclinical in vivo studies have demonstrated opaganib's potential to ameliorate inflammatory lung disorders, such as pneumonia, and has shown decreased fatality rates from influenza virus infection and ameliorated Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced lung injury by reducing the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, the company said.ALSO READ | Novavax vaccine efficacy data promising, encouraging: GovtALSO READ | Promising new antibodies against novel coronavirus found   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

93b3390bfa674af0826f4c834b94d424,"New grand jury seated as Donald Trump criminal probe continues. New York prosecutors investigating former President Donald Trump's business dealings have convened a new grand jury to hear evidence in the probe as the previous panel's term was set to run out, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Thursday.The development comes as the Manhattan district attorney's office is weighing whether to seek more indictments in a case that has already resulted in tax fraud charges against Trump's company, the Trump Organization, and its longtime CFO Allen Weisselberg.Trump himself remains under investigation after District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr led a multi-year fight to get access to the Republican's tax records.The person was not authorised to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity. The news of the new grand jury was first reported by The Washington Post.The Manhattan DA's office declined comment. A message seeking comment was left with a Trump Organization lawyer. Investigators working for Vance and New York Attorney General Letitia James have spent more than two years looking at whether the Trump Organization misled banks or tax officials about the value of the company's assets, inflating them to gain favourable loan terms or minimising them to reap tax savings.As part of a continuing civil investigation, James' office issued subpoenas to local governments in November 2019 for records pertaining to Trump's estate north of Manhattan, Seven Springs, and a tax benefit Trump received for placing land into a conservation trust. Vance issued subpoenas about a year ago seeking many of the same records.James' office has also been looking at similar issues relating to a Trump office building in New York City, a hotel in Chicago and a golf course near Los Angeles. Her office also won a series of court rulings forcing Trump's company and a law firm it hired to turn over troves of records.The New York Times reported last month that Westchester District Attorney Mimi Rocah had opened an investigation into whether the Trump Organization misled officials to cut taxes for a golf course.In the criminal case, Weisselberg has pleaded not guilty to charges that he collected more than USD 1.7 million in off-the-books compensation, including apartment rent, car payments and school tuition. Trump's company was also charged in the case, which prosecutors have described as a ""sweeping and audacious"" tax fraud scheme.Prosecutors have also been weighing whether to seek charges against the company's chief operating officer Matthew Calamari Sr. According to the indictment, from 2005 through this year, the Trump Organization and Weisselberg, 74, cheated tax authorities by conspiring to pay senior executives off the books by way of lucrative fringe benefits and other means. Weisselberg alone was accused of defrauding the federal, state and city governments out of more than USD 900,000 in unpaid taxes and undeserved tax refunds.Trump himself was not charged with any wrongdoing, but prosecutors noted he signed some of the checks at the centre of the case. In recent months, a pair of Trump Organization executives testified before the grand jury hearing evidence in the Manhattan case. Under New York law, grand jury witnesses are granted immunity and cannot be charged for conduct they testify about.One of the Trump executives granted immunity to testify before the grand jury is the company's director of security, Matthew Calamari Jr., the son of Matthew Calamari Sr. The other, senior vice president and controller, Jeffrey McConney, was first subpoenaed to testify in the spring and appeared before the panel again in September. At a September hearing, Weisselberg lawyer Bryan Scarlatos told a judge he had a ""strong reason to believe"" that more indictments were coming in the case.The grand jury that returned the Weisselberg and Trump Organization indictments was empanelled in the spring for a six-month term. The new grand jury will also meet for six months, overlapping the start of Alvin Bragg's tenure as district attorney.Bragg, a Democrat, won Tuesday's election and will take over in January for Vance, who is retiring.As a top deputy to New York's attorney general in 2018, Bragg helped oversee a lawsuit that led to the closure of Trump's charitable foundation over allegations that he used the nonprofit to further his political and business interests.In an interview prior to his election, Bragg told The Associated Press his prior experience handling mortgage fraud, money laundering and other white-collar investigations made him feel ""very equipped to follow the facts wherever they go"" in the Trump criminal probe.""I remember the moment sitting around the table with the attorney general deciding to file the case and the ultimate question was, is this a matter that we would file if it were someone else,"" Bragg said.""And we arrived with the answer that yes, this was the kind of conduct that was worthy of an attorney general action. It is that same philosophy and approach that I will take to the DA's office,"" he said.    /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_6038455064 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/06/0_ty5xt9tw/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_ty5xt9tw_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Facebook suspends former US President Donald Trump's account for two years"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""64"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_6038455064 = ''; jwsetup_6038455064(); function jwsetup_6038455064() { jwvidplayer_6038455064 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_6038455064"").setup(jwconfig_6038455064); jwvidplayer_6038455064.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_6038455064, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_ty5xt9tw\"", ns_st_pr=\""Facebook suspends former US President Donald Trump's account for two years\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Facebook suspends former US President Donald Trump's account for two years\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Facebook suspends former US President Donald Trump's account for two years\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-06-05\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-06-05\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/06/0_ty5xt9tw/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_6038455064.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_6038455064.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_6038455064.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_6038455064.stop(); jwvidplayer_6038455064.remove(); jwvidplayer_6038455064 = ''; jwsetup_6038455064(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_6038455064.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_6038455064.stop(); jwvidplayer_6038455064.remove(); jwvidplayer_6038455064 = ''; jwsetup_6038455064(); return; }); jwvidplayer_6038455064.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6038455064.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6038455064.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6038455064.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6038455064.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6038455064.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }   "

0613697ae68d8a7d0b301636e04c136d,"Twitter, Facebook suspend Trump's account over comment on US Capitol riotsIn an unprecedented step, Facebook and Twitter suspended President Donald Trump from posting to their platforms Wednesday following the storming of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.Twitter locked Trump out of his account for 12 hours and said that future violations by Trump could result in a permanent suspension. The company required the removal of three of Trump’s tweets, including a short video in which he urged those supporters to “go home” while also repeating falsehoods about the integrity of the presidential election. Trump’s account deleted those posts; had they remained, Twitter had threatened to extend his suspension.Facebook followed up in the evening, announcing that Trump wouldn’t be able to post for 24 hours following two violations of its policies. Also, Instagram blocked Trumps account for a day.""We are locking President Donald Trump’s Instagram account for 24 hours as well,"" said Adam Mosseri, Head of InstagramWhile some cheered the platforms’ actions, experts noted that the companies’ actions follow years of hemming and hawing on Trump and his supporters spreading dangerous misinformation and encouraging violence that have contributed to Wednesday’s violence.Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor and an expert on social media, said Wednesday’s events in Washington, D.C. are a direct result of Trump’s use of social media to spread propaganda and disinformation, and that the platforms should bear some responsibility for their inaction.“This is what happens,” said Grygiel. “We didn’t just see a breach at the Capitol. Social media platforms have been breached by the president repeatedly. This is disinformation. This was a coup attempt in the United States.”Grygiel said the platform’s decision to remove the video — and Twitter’s suspension — are too little, too late.“They’re creeping along towards firmer action,” Griegel said, calling Trump “Exhibit A” for the need for greater regulation of social media. “Social media is complicit in this because he has repeatedly used social media to incite violence. It’s a culmination of years of propaganda and abuse of media by the president of the United States.”Trump posted that video more than two hours after protesters entered the Capitol, interrupting lawmakers meeting in an extraordinary joint session to confirm the Electoral College results and President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.So far, YouTube has not taken similar action to muzzle Trump.Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of integrity, said on Twitter Wednesday that the video was removed because it “contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.”“This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video,” Rosen said on Twitter.Twitter initially left the video up but blocked people from being able to retweet it or comment on it. Only later in the day did the platform delete it entirely.Trump opened his video saying, “I know your pain. I know your hurt. But you have to go home now.”After repeating false claims about voter fraud affecting the election, Trump went on to say: “We can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You’re very special.”Republican lawmakers and previous administration officials had begged Trump to give a statement to his supporters to quell the violence. The statement came as authorities struggled to take control of a chaotic situation at the Capitol that led to the evacuation of lawmakers and the death of at least one person.Trump has harnessed social media — especially Twitter — as a potent tool for spreading misinformation about the election. Wednesday’s riot only increased calls to ban Trump from the platform.“The President has promoted sedition and incited violence,” Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement. “More than anything, what is happening right now at the Capitol is a direct result of the fear and disinformation that has been spewed consistently from the Oval Office.”Also Read: US Capitol Riots: Chaos, violence, mockery as pro-Trump mob occupies Congress, 1 killed"
91266f7b0ab9c41faaf4d7ff0de05b76,"People wearing protective masks walk around the famed Shibuya scramble crossing in a shopping and entertainment district.Taking an act-now-ask-questions-later approach, countries around the world slammed their doors shut again to try to keep the new omicron variant at bay Monday as more cases of the mutant coronavirus emerged and scientists raced to figure out just how dangerous it might be.Japan announced it would bar entry of all foreign visitors, joining Israel in doing so just days after the variant was identified by researchers in South Africa. Morocco banned all incoming flights. Other countries, including the U.S. and European Union members, have moved to prohibit travelers from arriving from southern Africa.Travelers infected with the new version have turned up in a cascading number of countries over the past few days, and new cases in Portugal and Scotland have raised fears that the variant may already be spreading locally.“Many of us might think we are done with COVID-19. It’s not done with us,” warned Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization.The infections showed the near impossibility of keeping the genie in the bottle in a globalized world of travel and open borders.Yet, many tried to do just that, even against the urging of the WHO, which noted that border closings often have limited effect and can wreak havoc on lives and livelihoods.Some argued that such restrictions could provide valuable time to analyze the new variant. Little is known about it, including whether it is more contagious, more likely to cause serious illness or more able to evade the protection of vaccines.While the initial global response to COVID-19 was criticized as slow and haphazard, the reaction to the new variant came quickly.“This time the world showed it is learning,” said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, singling out South African President Cyril Ramaphosa for praise. “South Africa’s analytic work and transparency and sharing its results was indispensable in allowing a swift global response. It no doubt saved many lives.”The WHO has praised Botswana as well as South Africa for quickly alerting the world to the presence of the new variant — and many have warned the countries should not be punished for their speed.But that did not hold von der Leyen back from successfully pushing the 27-nation EU to agree on a ban on flights from seven southern African nations over the weekend — similar to measures many other countries have taken. On Monday, EU members Spain and Poland followed through by announcing travel and quarantine restrictions.Cases had already been reported in EU nations Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands before Portuguese authorities identified 13 cases of omicron among team members of the Belenenses professional soccer club. Authorities reported that one member had recently traveled to South Africa. Its game against Benfica over the weekend had be abandoned at halftime for lack of players.Quarantining also became an issue when Dutch military police had to arrest a husband and wife who left a hotel where they were being held after testing positive and boarded a plane bound for Spain.“Quarantine is not obligatory, but we assume people will act responsibly,” spokeswoman Petra Faber said.And after Scotland reported its first six cases, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned that “there might already be some community transmission of this variant.”Taking no chances, Japan, which has yet to detect any omicron cases, reimposed border controls that it eased earlier this month for short-term business visitors, foreign students and workers.“We are taking the step as an emergency precaution to prevent a worst-case scenario in Japan,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said. The new measures begin Tuesday.Israel likewise decided to bar entry to foreigners, and Morocco said it would suspend all incoming flights for two weeks starting Monday.Despite the global worry, scientists cautioned that it is still unclear whether omicron is more alarming than other versions of the virus that has killed more than 5 million people. And in some parts of the world, authorities were moving in the opposite direction.In Malaysia, officials went ahead with the partial reopening of a bridge connecting it to the city-state of Singapore. And New Zealand announced it will press ahead with plans to reopen internally after months of shutdown, though it is also restricting travel from nine southern African nations.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that she didn’t anticipate any further restrictions and that bars, restaurants and gyms in Auckland can reopen, ending a coronavirus lockdown that began in August.“We’ve come through the past two years of COVID in better shape than nearly anywhere in the world,” Ardern said, pointing to low death rates, a growing economy and high vaccination rates.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health in the United States, meanwhile, said no data as yet suggests the new variant causes more serious illness than previous versions.Collins echoed several experts in saying the news should make everyone redouble their efforts to use the tools the world already has, including vaccinations, booster shots and measures such as mask-wearing.The U.S. is banning travel from South Africa and seven other southern African countries starting Monday. “It’s going to give us a period of time to enhance our preparedness,” the United States’ top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said on ABC’s “This Week.”Fauci said it will take about two more weeks to have more definitive information on the transmissibility, severity and other characteristics of omicron, according to the White House.ALSO READ | Omicron scare: Sample of South Africa returnee in Bengaluru is 'different from Delta variant'ALSO READ | Omicron variant scare: Mumbai man who returned from South Africa tests Covid positive"

He purposely sabotaged her security so that she would be assassinated and taken off the scene.""Bilawal Bhutto said that Musharraf, who is in self-imposed exile in Dubai, had directly threatened Bhutto and told her that her security was based on the state of her relationship with him. He claimed that on the day of her assassination, the security cordon was taken off from her by the former military ruler.The PPP chairman said that he personally holds the former president responsible for the murder but as he doesn't have any details of him giving directions on a call or holding a meeting to convey any secret message, he will not unnecessarily blame any state institution.The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in its judgment on August 31 had declared Musharraf an absconder in the assassination case and acquitted five alleged operatives of the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) due to lack of evidence.Two police officers were jailed for 17 years each for negligence vis-a-vis Bhutto's security. The court also ordered confiscation of Musharraf's properties.Bilawal Bhutto added that the ATC hearing Bhutto's case ignored the UN investigation report, ignored the government's investigation, ignored phone call recordings and did not take into account DNA evidence.He said the court gave a clean chit to the terrorists, awarded punishments to the police officials involved in washing the crime scene but also immediately approved their bail.Bilawal Bhutto told the PPP supporters that Benazir had been punished for propagating democracy and for her deep love for the people.""My leader (Benazir), you were punished for fighting against dictatorship... for fighting for women and speaking for the oppressed. You were punished for loving people.""Bilawal also accused the incumbent government of undoing his mother's legacy, saying: ""They've weakened the democracy and Parliament. Small provinces are being isolated from the federal government. This is a murderous government.""Bilawal also attached some blame for his mother's unresolved murder case to the judiciary. "
51bb34365b77abf49d445c686936faa4,"Heavy gunfire reported near Guinea’s presidential palaceHeavy gunfire erupted early Sunday near the presidential palace in Guinea’s capital, witnesses said, raising security concerns in a country with a long history of military power grabs and coup attempts.It wasn’t immediately known whether President Alpha Conde was home at the time the shooting began, according to witnesses in the Kaloum neighborhood of Conakry.Conde has faced mounting criticism ever since he sought a third term in office last year, saying the constitutional term limits didn’t apply in his case. He was ultimately reelected, but the move prompted violent street demonstrations, and the opposition said dozens were killed.Conde came to power in 2010 in the country’s first democratic elections since independence from France in 1958. Many saw his presidency as a fresh start for the mineral-rich country, which has been mired by decades of corrupt, authoritarian rule.Opponents, though, say he has failed to improve the lives of Guineans, most of whom live in poverty despite the country’s vast mineral riches.In 2011, he survived an assassination attempt when mutinous soldiers fired at the palace.ALSO READ: 13 police personnel killed in suspected IS attack in northern IraqALSO READ: Suicide bomber blows himself up in Pakistan; 3 killed, 20 injured "
22655f2eb34f40ad6b649a8c8babb1f9,"Turkey calls on Kurdish fighters to lay arms, vacate borderAs Russia and the United States each launched diplomatic forays to end Turkey’s invasion of northern Syria, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday defied pressure for a ceasefire and said the only way the offensive would end was if Syrian Kurdish fighters leave a designated border area “by tonight.”Russia said it was working to prevent a conflict between Turkish troops and Syrian government forces that have moved into Kurdish-held areas in the northeast. The Kurdish administration invited the Syrian military in to shield it from the Turkish attack.A day ahead of a visit by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence to Ankara, tasked with negotiating out an end to the attack, the Kremlin said Erdogan had accepted an invitation by Russian President Vladimir Putin to visit Russia “in coming days” to discuss Syria.Russia has moved quickly to further entrench its leadership role in the region after President Donald Trump ordered the pullout of American forces in northeastern Syria. The American move effectively abandoned the Kurdish fighters who were allied with the U.S. and cleared the way for Turkey’s invasion aimed at crushing them. After heavy criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, Washington then scrambled to find new leverage with the Turks, imposing economic sanctions aimed at forcing a cease-fireErdogan told reporters Wednesday that he had “no problem” with visiting Russia. But he suggested a planned Nov. 13 trip to Washington was now uncertain due to calls within the U.S. Congress to sanction Turkey.The trip “is something to be assessed” after the talks with the American delegation, he said, adding that the sanctions and criticisms in the U.S. constituted “great disrespect toward the Turkish Republic.”In an address to his ruling party legislators, Erdogan said Turkey would not be coerced into stopping its offensive or accept offers for mediation with the Kurdish fighters, which Turkey considers as terrorists. He vowed to press ahead with the incursion until Turkish troops reach a depth of 30 to 35 kilometres (18-20 miles) inside Syria along a border area where Turkey intends to form a “safe zone.”“Our proposal is for the terrorists to lay down their arms, leave their equipment, destroy the traps they have created and leave the safe zone we as designated, as of tonight,” Erdogan said. “If this is done, our Operation Peace Spring will end by itself.”Pence is joined in his Turkey visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser Robert O’Brien, aiming to negotiate a stop to the fighting in Syria’s northeast.Erdogan ruled out direct or indirect talks with the Kurdish fighters, saying Turkey will not negotiate with “terrorists.” “We are not looking for a peace mediator nor do we need one,” he said.With the Turkish assault in its eighth day, Turkish forces and Kurdish fighters were still battling heavily Wednesday over the border town of Ras al-Ayn. Turkey had announced it captured the town days ago, but its hold now appeared uncertain amid Kurdish incursion.America’s abrupt withdrawal of its troops pushed the Kurds to strike a deal with the Russia-backed government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, allowing its forces to return to regions of northern Syria it had abandoned at the height of the eight-year-old civil war.It has also allowed Moscow to take a more prominent role as an interlocutor among Assad, the former U.S.-allied Kurds and the U.S.’s NATO ally Turkey. On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is committed to mediating between the Syrian government and Turkey.Russia has already announced it had deployed troops outside the flashpoint town of Manbij to keep apart the Syrian military and Turkish-led forces. Syrian forces took control of Manbij as U.S. troops completed their pull-out from the town on Tuesday. The Syrian and Russian deployments appear to have thwarted Turkey’s hopes to capture the town, located just west of the Euphrates, in its offensive.Lavrov also said Moscow will also continue to encourage Syria’s Kurds and government to seek rapprochement following the U.S. withdrawal. The Kurds are hoping to reach a deal with Damascus that preserves at least some degree of the autonomy they seized for themselves amid Syria’s civil war.During a visit to Iraq last week, Lavrov met with the leaders of the Kurdish autonomous region and said that Moscow is sympathetic to their need for autonomy.Lavrov also blamed the United States and Western nations for undermining the Syrian state, saying this pushed “the Kurds toward separatism and confrontation with Arab tribes.”In another sign of Moscow’s rising profile, France suggested it will also work more closely with Russia in Syria. French Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian said in an interview on French television channel BFM Wednesday that France is notably now looking to Russia, given their “common interests” in defeating the Islamic State group in Syria.He called on European and other members of the coalition fighting the IS in Syria to regroup as the U.S. appeared to abdicate its leadership role in the region."
d1904d90d4a6fbaaf980223a1d8e89dd,"Indian-origin doctor in UK offers evidence-based ‘21-Day Immunity Plan’ to fight COVID-19 (image used for representational purpose)A UK-based Indian-origin doctor, who has been championing an anti-obesity drive as a means to combat the severe effects of COVID-19, on Thursday released a new book that offers a “simple, evidence-based” plan to help improve health parameters. Dr Aseem Malhotra’s ‘The 21-Day Immunity Plan: How to Rapidly Improve Your Metabolic Health and Resilience to Fight Infection’ is pegged as a tried and tested method of how in just 21 days people can prevent, improve and even potentially reverse many of the underlying risk factors that exacerbate how infections, including coronavirus, affect humans and improve their ability to recover.“Poor metabolic health equals poor immune health. The good news is that within weeks of making simple changes to what we eat, how we move and reducing stress through meditation, we can rapidly improve – both making us healthier and more resilient to infection,” said Malhotra, a National Health Service (NHS) trained cardiologist.The medic says he wrote the book, which will hit the shelves in India in the coming weeks, in just six weeks because he and his publishers wanted it out as soon as possible to help readers build resilience to infection, given the current coronavirus pandemic. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock had also consulted him, seeking evidence linking COVID-19 and obesity.“I informed him, as I make the case in the book, that obesity is just the tip of the diet related disease iceberg. In other words, we're all vulnerable,” said Malhotra, who is also a visiting Professor of Evidence Based Medicine at Salvador’s Bahiana School of Medicine and Public Health in Brazil.The ‘21-Day Immunity Plan’, published by Hodder & Stoughton, lays out the benefits to global health of highly effective lifestyle changes, which the author himself has been following and prescribing to many of his patients.“I follow my own advice and I prescribe this to my patients who see rapid improvements in their health. My metabolic parameters are all normal despite having a strong family history of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes and a recent body composition scan revealed my metabolic age is 29 even though my actual age is 42,” he said.Among the many followers of this health routine is British-Indian filmmaker Gurinder Chadha, who is on course to reverse her type 2 diabetes.“When lockdown happened, I was very worried about catching COVID-19. Being a type 2 diabetic with not great glucose control I knew I was at high risk for severe infection,” said Chadha, the maker of box-office hits like ‘Bend It Like Beckham’ and ‘Bride and Prejudice’.“I finally decided to do something about my obesity and T2 [diabetes]. I immediately took Aseem’s lifestyle advice, specifically cutting out all sugar and refined carbs and within weeks I’ve come close to reversing my type 2 diabetes. The best part is I was still able to enjoy my food and felt mentally and physically better as my body became healthier. Read this book and follow the plan, it may well save your life,” says Chadha, in her endorsement for the new book.As the co-author of ‘The Pioppi Diet’, Malhotra is considered a pioneer of the lifestyle medicine movement in the UK and in 2018, was ranked by software company Onalytica as the No. 1 doctor in the world influencing obesity thinking. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year, he had issued a warning for Indians to urgently cut out ultra-processed foods from their diet to build resilience.“India is particularly vulnerable, having a very high prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases,” he said.“Specifically, conditions such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease are three of the major risk factors for death from COVID-19. This is rooted in excess body fat, a cluster of conditions known as a metabolic syndrome,” he added.Malhotra warns that the medications that are used for type 2 diabetes and many of the other conditions have “very, very marginal effects” in terms of improving lifespan or reducing risk of death and they also come with side effects. Now his new book hopes to further highlight the importance of lifestyle changes in fighting against some of these conditions. "

57581ed42eedfbcd6e2deb1f7c070296,"Representative Image.Pakistan is currently expanding its uranium-enrichment and plutonium production facilities. According to reports, Pakistan currently has 140 to 150 nuclear warheads and the stockpile is most likely to shoot up to 220 to 250 by 2025.""We estimate that the country's stockpile could more realistically grow to 220 to 250 warheads by 2025, if the current trend continues. If that happens, it would make Pakistan the world's fifth-largest nuclear weapon state,"" Hans M Kristensen, Robert S Norris and Julia Diamond said in the report 'Pakistani nuclear forces 2018'. Kristensen, the lead author, is the director of the Nuclear Information Project with the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) in Washington, DC. Over the past decade, the US assessment of nuclear weapons security in Pakistan appears to have changed considerably from confidence to concern, particularly as a result of the introduction of tactical nuclear weapons, the report said. ""With several delivery systems in development, four plutonium production reactors, and its uranium enrichment facilities expanding, however, Pakistan has a stockpile that will likely increase further over the next 10 years,"" says the report. Pakistan continues to expand its nuclear arsenal with more warheads, more delivery systems and a growing fissile materials production industry, it said. ""Analysis of a large number of commercial satellite images of Pakistani army garrisons and air force bases shows what appear to be mobile launchers and underground facilities that might be related to nuclear forces,"" said the report. The authors observe that the size of the increase will depend on many factors. Two key factors will be how many nuclear-capable launchers Pakistan plans to deploy, and how much the Indian nuclear arsenal grows. ""Speculation that Pakistan may become the world's third-largest nuclear weapon state – with a stockpile of some 350 warheads a decade from now – are, we believe, exaggerated, not least because that would require a buildup two to three times faster than the growth rate over the past two decades,"" the authors said. According to the report, Pakistan is modifying its nuclear posture with new short-range nuclear-capable weapon systems to counter military threats below the strategic level. ""The efforts seek to create a full-spectrum deterrent that is designed not only to respond to nuclear attacks, but also to counter an Indian conventional incursion onto Pakistani territory,"" it said. ""This development has created considerable concern in other countries, including the United States, which fears that it lowers the threshold for nuclear use in a military conflict with India,"" the report added. (With agency inputs) "

1343af43a906abf4a9bdd9156ae16103,"A medical worker wearing protective gear collects a sample from a resident at a coronavirus test site in Xichen District in Beijing on Jan 25, 2022. Scientists and health officials around the world are keeping their eyes on a descendant of the omicron variant that has been found in at least 40 countries, including the United States. This version of the coronavirus, which scientists call BA.2, is widely considered stealthier than the original version of omicron because particular genetic traits make it somewhat harder to detect. Some scientists worry it could also be more contagious. But they say there’s a lot they still don’t know about it, including whether it evades vaccines better or causes more severe disease. WHERE HAS IT SPREAD? Since mid-November, more than three dozen countries have uploaded nearly 15,000 genetic sequences of BA.2 to GISAID, a global platform for sharing coronavirus data. As of Tuesday morning, 96 of those sequenced cases came from the U.S. “Thus far, we haven’t seen it start to gain ground” in the U.S., said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas, which has identified three cases of BA.2. The mutant appears much more common in Asia and Europe. In Denmark, it made up 45% of all COVID-19 cases in mid-January, up from 20% two weeks earlier, according to Statens Serum Institut, which falls under the Danish Ministry of Health. WHAT’S KNOWN ABOUT THIS VERSION OF THE VIRUS? BA.2 has lots of mutations. About 20 of them in the spike protein that studs the outside of the virus are shared with the original omicron. But it also has additional genetic changes not seen in the initial version. It’s unclear how significant those mutations are, especially in a population that has encountered the original omicron, said Dr. Jeremy Luban, a virologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. For now, the original version, known as BA.1, and BA.2 are considered subsets of omicron. But global health leaders could give it its own Greek letter name if it is deemed a globally significant “variant of concern.” The quick spread of BA.2 in some places raises concerns it could take off. “We have some indications that it just may be as contagious or perhaps slightly more contagious than (original) omicron since it’s able to compete with it in some areas,” Long said. “But we don’t necessarily know why that is.” An initial analysis by scientists in Denmark shows no differences in hospitalizations for BA.2 compared with the original omicron. Scientists there are still looking into this version’s infectiousness and how well current vaccines work against it. It’s also unclear how well treatments will work against it. Doctors also don’t yet know for sure if someone who’s already had COVID-19 caused by omicron can be sickened again by BA.2. But they’re hopeful, especially that a prior omicron infection might lessen the severity of disease if someone later contracts BA.2. The two versions of omicron have enough in common that it’s possible that infection with the original mutant “will give you cross-protection against BA.2,” said Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, an infectious diseases expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Scientists will be conducting tests to see if antibodies from an infection with the original omicron “are able to neutralize BA.2 in the laboratory and then extrapolate from there,” he said. HOW CONCERNED ARE HEALTH AGENCIES? The World Health Organization classifies omicron overall as a variant of concern, its most serious designation of a coronavirus mutant, but it doesn’t single out BA.2 with a designation of its own. Given its rise in some countries, however, the agency says investigations of BA.2 “should be prioritized.” The UK Health Security Agency, meanwhile, has designated BA.2 a “variant under investigation,” citing the rising numbers found in the U.K. and internationally. Still, the original version of omicron remains dominant in the U.K. WHY IS IT HARDER TO DETECT? The original version of omicron had specific genetic features that allowed health officials to rapidly differentiate it from delta using a certain PCR test because of what’s known as “S gene target failure.” BA.2 doesn’t have this same genetic quirk. So on the test, Long said, BA.2 looks like delta. “It’s not that the test doesn’t detect it; it’s just that it doesn’t look like omicron,” he said. “Don’t get the impression that ‘stealth omicron’ means we can’t detect it. All of our PCR tests can still detect it.” WHAT SHOULD YOU DO TO PROTECT YOURSELF? Doctors advise the same precautions they have all along: Get vaccinated and follow public health guidance about wearing masks, avoiding crowds and staying home when you’re sick. “The vaccines are still providing good defense against severe disease, hospitalization and death,” Long said. “Even if you’ve had COVID 19 before- you’ve had a natural infection- the protection from the vaccine is still stronger, longer lasting and actually ... does well for people who’ve been previously infected.” The latest version is another reminder that the pandemic hasn’t ended. “We all wish that it was over,” Long said, ”but until we get the world vaccinated, we’re going to be at risk of having new variants emerge.”  ALSO READ: Why Omicron variant is less severe than DeltaScientists and health officials around the world are keeping their eyes on a descendant of the omicron variant that has been found in at least 40 countries, including the United States.This version of the coronavirus, which scientists call BA.2, is widely considered stealthier than the original version of omicron because particular genetic traits make it somewhat harder to detect.

216e9bdd78b2516c94c994524dd547dd,"President Joe Biden speaks about the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the East Room of the White House.President Joe Biden on Thursday announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, charging that Russian leader Vladimir Putin “chose this war"" and that his country will bear the consequences of his action.The sanctions target Russian banks, oligarchs and high-tech sectors, Biden said. The United States and its allies will block assets of four large Russian banks, impose export controls and sanction oligarchs.Biden also said the U.S. will be deploying additional forces to Germany to bolster NATO after the invasion of Ukraine, which is not a member of the defense organization.The penalties fall in line with the White House’s insistence that it would look to hit Russia’s financial system and Putin's inner circle, while also imposing export controls that would aim to starve Russia’s industries and military of U.S. semiconductors and other high-tech products.“Putin is the aggressor,” Biden said. “Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences.""Biden, for now, held off imposing some of the most severe sanctions, including cutting Russia out of the SWIFT payment system, which allows for the transfers of money from bank to bank around the globe, or Russia's energy sector.Biden announced the sanctions while Ukraine’s government reported mounting casualties as Russian forces attack from the east, north and south.Biden spoke to Americans from the White House hours after holding a virtual meeting with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also joined the meeting.The president also met with his national security team on Thursday morning in the Situation Room as he looked to flesh out U.S. moves in the rapidly escalating crisis.While Biden described the sanctions as severe, Ukrainian officials urged the U.S. and West to go further and cut the Russians from the SWIFT financial system.“We demand the disconnection of Russia from SWIFT, the introduction of a no-fly zone over Ukraine and other effective steps to stop the aggressor,” Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a tweet.The Biden administration, however, has shown some reluctance to cut Russia from SWIFT, at least immediately, because of concerns the move could also have enormous ramifications for Europe and other Western economies. Biden, answering questions from reporters, appeared to push a decision on SWIFT to European allies.“It is always an option but right now that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,” Biden said. He also contended that the financial sanctions he announced would be more damaging to Russia.Also Read | Russia Ukraine war: PM Modi dials Putin, appeals for immediate cessation of violenceAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine war: What India needs to note from West’s reaction with respect to Pakistan and China"

As per reports, Pakistan may remain on the FATF grey list beyond February 2020, mainly because of its risk profile and in view of two simultaneous evaluations.Senior officials provided this information to a parliamentary panel on Thursday, adding that the government has recovered only about $35 million in taxes on foreign assets worth about $7.4 billion of Pakistanis reported by the international community under information exchange arrangements, Dawn news reported.""Pakistan faces greater challenges than many other countries because of its risk profile,"" Hammad Azhar, the Minister responsible for economic affairs division, said on Thursday while speaking at a meeting of the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue.He said that some countries had been removed from the grey list after just 80 per cent compliance while Pakistan was being pressurised to ensure 100 per cent compliance with the action plan.""Pakistan is being viewed from a very high threshold; there is a political element to this,"" he said, adding that Afghanistan was not on the FATF grey list.The Minister said Pakistan was taking timely steps to meet the FATF targets as it was partially compliant on 22 of the 27 points in the action plan and non-compliant on five targets of the International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG).Pakistan will submit its next report on its action plan to the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) by December 7. The APG will return the report with its questions and feedback by December 17.Islamabad will be required to respond to these observations by January 7, 2020, reports Dawn news.Pakistan's technical team will attend a meeting of the APG joint working group in the third week of January to address any further questions and concerns. The joint working group will then submit its report to the FATF by end of January and the FATF plenary to be held by mid-February would finally decide whether Pakistan should be removed from the grey list or not.Azhar said the government was optimistic that it would achieve sufficient progress for the country to be removed from the grey list, but then it was also being reviewed simultaneously for a 40-point action plan of the APG for which the deadline was October 2020.He said it was not clear what would the FATF decide about the intervening period - between February under the ICRG and October 2020 under the APG. He said there was a possibility that Pakistan would remain on the grey list until October next year even if it complied with the action plan for February."
955e45deb89dfc54f2ab3712bf3328ba,"In this photo released by the Metro Nashville Police Department, Travis Reinking sits in a police car after being arrested in Nashville.A 25-year-old in a rented van plowed down a Toronto sidewalk crowded with lunchtime strollers Monday, killing 10 people and injuring 15 in what appeared to witnesses and the city’s police chief as a deliberate attack. The driver was quickly arrested in a tense but brief confrontation with officers a few blocks away.Witnesses and the police chief said the driver, identified by authorities as Alek Minassian, was moving fast and appeared to intentionally jump a curb in the North York neighborhood as people filled the sidewalks on a warm afternoon. He continued for more than a mile, knocking out a fire hydrant and leaving bodies strewn in his wake.Officials would not comment on a possible motive except to play down a possible connection to terrorism, a thought that occurred to many following a series of attacks involving trucks and pedestrians in Europe and the presence in Toronto this week of Cabinet ministers from the G7 nations.Still, Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders said he did not think it was an accident.“The incident definitely looked deliberate,” Saunders said at a news conference Monday night as he announced that the initial death toll of nine had risen to 10 after another victim died at a hospital. He said 15 others were hospitalized.Saunders said Minassian, who lives in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill, had not been known to police previously.Asked if there was any evidence of a connection to international terrorism, the chief said only, “Based on what we have there’s nothing that has it to compromise the national security at this time.”A senior national government official said earlier that authorities had not turned over the investigation to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, a sign that investigators believed it unlikely terrorism was the motive. The official agreed to reveal that information only if not quoted by name.Authorities released few details in the case, saying the investigation was still underway, with witnesses being interviewed and surveillance video being examined.“I can assure the public all our available resources have been brought in to investigate this tragic situation,” Toronto Police Services Deputy Chief Peter Yuen said earlier.The incident occurred as Cabinet ministers from the major industrial countries were gathered in Canada to discuss a range of international issues in the run-up to the G7 meeting near Quebec City in June. Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale called the incident a “horrific attack” and said the G7 foreign ministers extended their condolences.The driver was heading south on busy Yonge Street around 1:30 p.m. and the streets were crowded with people enjoying an unseasonably warm day when the van jumped onto the sidewalk.Ali Shaker, who was driving near the van at the time, told Canadian broadcast outlet CP24 that the driver appeared to be moving deliberately through the crowd at more than 30 mph.“He just went on the sidewalk,” a distraught Shaker said. “He just started hitting everybody, man. He hit every single person on the sidewalk. Anybody in his way he would hit.”Witness Peter Kang told CTV News that the driver did not seem to make any effort to stop.“If it was an accident he would have stopped,” Kang said. “But the person just went through the sidewalk. He could have stopped.”Video broadcast on several Canadian outlets showed police arresting the driver, dressed in dark clothes, after officers surrounded him and his rental Ryder van several blocks from where the incident occurred in the North York neighborhood of northern Toronto. He appeared to make some sort of gesture at the police with an object in his hand just before they ordered him to lie down on the ground and took him away.Witness Phil Zullo told Canadian Press that he saw police arresting the suspect and people “strewn all over the road” where the incident occurred.“I must have seen about five, six people being resuscitated by bystanders and by ambulance drivers,” Zullo said. “It was awful. Brutal.”Police shut down the Yonge and Finch intersection following the incident and Toronto’s transit agency said it had suspended service on the subway line running through the area.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his sympathies for those involved.“We should all feel safe walking in our cities and communities,” he said. “We are monitoring this situation closely, and will continue working with our law enforcement partners around the country to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians.”"
8682332aa505bcd2bdcd84dcaa765300,"Firefighters scale a 3-story pile of rocks in Tlalnepantla, on outskirts of Mexico City. A section of mountain on the outskirts of Mexico City gave way Friday, plunging rocks the size of small homes onto a densely populated neighborhood and leaving at least one person dead and 10 others missing.Firefighters scaled a three-story pile of rocks that appeared to be resting on houses in Tlalnepantla, which is part of Mexico state. The state surrounds the capital on three sides.As rescuers climbed the immense pile of debris, they occasionally raised their fists in the air, the familiar signal for silence to listen for people trapped below. Firefighters and volunteers formed bucket brigades to pass 5-gallon containers of smaller debris away as they excavated.“In this moment our priority is focused on rescuing the people who unfortunately were surprised at the site of the incident,” said Tlalnepantla Mayor Raciel Pérez Cruz in a video message. Authorities had evacuated surrounding homes and asked people to avoid the area so rescuers could work.Rescuers carried a body on a stretcher covered with a sheet past AP journalists. The Mexico state Civil Defense agency said in a statement that at least 10 people were reported missing.Among the volunteers were 30-year-old construction worker Martin Carmona, 30, and his 14-year-old son. “They organized us in a chain to take out buckets of sand, stone and rubble,” Carmona said. “A co-worker lives there. He has a wife and two young children under the debris.”Carmona and his son arrived to the pile before government rescuers and his friend was already there digging for his wife and kids.Neighbors began to complain that they need more help and organization.Carmona said rescuers heard children, but after two hours of removing debris, authorities told volunteers to leave the area. Only relatives stayed to help the rescuers.Search dogs clambered over the rubble with their handlers.Ana Luisa Borges, 39, said she lives just three houses down from those hit by the landslide.“It thundered horribly,” she said of the sound of the slide. “I grabbed my youngest son and ran out (of the house). Then came a very big cloud of dust.” Fortunately, her other four children were in school.“There are a number of houses there,” she said of the slide area. “There was a building, but they tell us there are people there and children. I saw one person come out with head injury.”Borges said they have been warned that another rock could come down and that she didn’t know where they were going to sleep tonight.“They’ve only told us that we have to leave (our homes),” she said.Tlalnepantla officials announced they were opening several shelters for displaced residents.The neighborhood is a heap of jumbled houses climbing the mountainside, many with corrugated tin roofs, separated in places by just a steep staircase.One massive boulder stopped against a two-story house barely its equal, knocking out the front wall and spilling the home’s contents into the street. A path of destruction traced uphill.Maximinio Andrade, who lives with his parents and siblings- 14 family members in all- near the slide walked down the steep street pushing a flat-screen television on a hand cart. He had not been home at the time of the landslide, but feared thieves would enter now that the surrounding homes had been evacuated.“They’ve already started stealing from the destroyed homes,” he said.National Guard troops and rescue teams carrying lengths of rope made their way through narrow streets.Images from the area showed a segment of the steep, green side of the peak known as Chiquihuite sheared off above a field of giant rubble with closely packed homes remaining on either side.Mexico state Gov. Alfredo del Mazo said via Twitter that local, state and federal authorities were coordinating to secure the zone in case of more slides and to remove rubble to locate possible victims.The landslide follows days of heavy rain in central Mexico and a 7.0-magnitude earthquake Tuesday night near Acapulco that shook buildings 200 miles (320 kilometers) away in Mexico City.While visiting the scene later Friday, Del Mazo said authorities believe four homes were destroyed in the landslide and another 80 were evacuated as a precaution.“It’s likely the earthquake and the intense rain we have had in recent days have affected (the area) and for this came the landslide and the break up of the mountain,” he said.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

f1ccb6a38a6e529523cb09cddc73e5d5,"Image for representationA joint motion, combining five different resolutions tabled by Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) against India's Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), has been placed on the final agenda for debate at the Plenary session in Brussels on Wednesday. However, an expected vote on the motion on Thursday has been postponed until the Parliament's Plenary session in March.""Following a decision by MEPs at the opening of today's Plenary session in Brussels, the vote on the resolution on India's Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 has been postponed to the March session,” said a statement from the European Parliament, as it confirmed that the debate on the motion is to go ahead as scheduled later on Wednesday evening.The reason behind the postponement of the vote is unconfirmed but will come as a boost to the Indian government's efforts against such a motion being voted on by the European Parliament.The motion takes note of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) statement last month, which described the CAA as ""fundamentally discriminatory in nature"", and also of other UN as well as the European Union (EU) guidelines on human rights as it calls on the Indian government to ""repeal the discriminatory amendments"".The debate on CAA on Wednesday will follow the European Parliament’s historic ratification of the Brexit bill, under which the UK is set to formally leave the economic bloc on Friday.""While the CAA's stated goal of protecting persecuted groups is welcome, an effective national asylum and refugee policy should be just and holistic in nature and apply to all those in need,"" notes the motion, which describes the CAA as ""discriminatory in nature and dangerously divisive"".The Indian government has maintained that the CAA, which was passed by the Indian Parliament last month, is an internal matter of the country and stressed that the goal is to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries. It has been extremely critical of the move in Brussels, which the European Commission – the executive arm of the economic bloc – has sought to distance itself from.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday wrote to European Parliament President David Maria Sassoli over the resolutions, saying it is inappropriate for one legislature to pass judgement on another and the practice can be misused by vested interests.""As members of Inter Parliamentary Union, we should respect sovereign processes of fellow legislatures, especially in democracies,"" Birla said in the letter. The European Parliament motion is critical of any protection being denied to Muslims and that even though India also shares a border with Bhutan, Burma, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the CAA does not bring Sri Lankan Tamils under its purview, who form the largest refugee group in India and who have been resident in the country for over 30 years.""Amnesty International India has pointed out that the CAA does not bring under its purview other persecuted minorities, including Muslim populations such as the Rohingya in Burma, Ahmadis in Pakistan, Hazaras in Afghanistan and Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh,"" it notes.There is also a reference to the Indian government's ""push"" for a nationwide citizenship verification process, the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which it says ""aims to strip Muslims of their citizenship rights while protecting those of Hindus and other non-Muslims"".The motion combines the separate resolutions tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE), Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE), Renew Europe Group (Renew) and European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) Group, representing around 560 of a total 751 MEPs.A sixth group, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), had withdrawn its resolution and references to the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in some of the resolutions have not found their way into the final motion.Such a move, which has been characterised under the ""Relations with Asian countries"" section by the economic bloc, are used as a basis for engagement of EU member countries with specific nations. If it is passed during a vote, now scheduled in March, it will be formally sent to the Indian government and Parliament as well as to the European Commission chiefs.While EU officials are keen to highlight that the motion reflects individual views of MEPs and does not reflect an EU-wide stance, the impact of the motion is likely to resonate with the EU-India relationship as the motion notes that the Strategic Partnership between the European Union and India is based on the shared values of democracy and respect for human rights.Also Read | Jamia violence: Delhi Police releases photos of 70 people involved in anti-CAA protestsWatch | CAA protests: 2 dead in WB's Murshidabad, 15 injured in Bihar's Sitamarhi   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

619ff5f2e4928c0b72b844242a1534d9,"China hits back at US with 25 per cent tariff hike on American products In a retaliatory measure, China today decided to impose new tariffs of 25 per cent worth USD 50 billion on 106 American products, including aircraft and cars, as the world's two largest economies edged closer towards an all-out trade war. The move comes after the Trump administration yesterday published a list of about 1,300 Chinese exports that could be targeted for tariffs. The Chinese Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, in a retaliatory measure, decided to impose additional tariff of 25 per cent on 106 items of products under 14 categories worth USD 50 billion, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement. The date of implementation will depend on when the US government imposes the tariffs on Chinese products, it said. ""Disregarding strong representations by China, the US announced the tariff proposals that are completely unfounded, a typical unilateralist and protectionist practice that China strongly condemns and firmly opposes,"" China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said today. The MOC said the US published the list in disregard of the mutually-beneficial and win-win nature of the China-US commercial cooperation in the past 40 years, the appeal of the Chinese and American business communities and the interests of consumers, it said.   The move went against the interests of China, the US and the world economy, violating the basic principles and spirit of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it said.The US plans to apply the tariffs to about USD 50 billion worth of goods to punish China for its alleged theft of trade secrets, including software, patents and other technology. US President Donald Trump is demanding China to cut down USD 375 billion trade deficit by USD 100 billion in about a month. His move sparked concerns over a trade war between the two largest economies of the world. China has already slapped tariffs on 128 US products, including wine and pork, totalling to USD 3 billion in retaliation to Trump's move to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium. China plans to immediately bring relevant US practice to the dispute settlement body of the WTO, and is ready to take countermeasures on US products with equal force, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. ""We have the confidence and ability to respond to any US trade protectionist measures,"" the MOC said. Yesterday, another Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told media that China will not shy away from a trade war and fight till the end. ""We keep reiterating that China won't initiate a trade war, and a trade war is the last thing we want. However, we will not be afraid of it. If someone is bent on waging it and even closing in on our doorstep, then we will keep them company and let's see who last to the end,"" he said. Trump signed a memorandum on March 22 that could impose tariffs on Chinese imports and restrictions on Chinese investment in the US. The memorandum is based on a Section 301 investigation, launched by the Trump administration in August 2017, into alleged Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer practices. "

She won a nine-year term on the tribunal that adjudicates disputes arising over the UNCLOS, UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the agreements between countries that give its jurisdiction. The tribunal is based in Hamburg, Germany and was setup in 1996. Neeru Chadha was the only candidate to be elected in the first round from the Asian Pacific Group. There were around 168 countries that are parties to UNCLOS voted.Judge P Chandrasekhara Rao, who served as the President of the tribunal from 1999 to 2002, completed his second nine-year-term this year. He is the Indian currently on the tribunal. Neeru Chadha was the first woman to be the chief legal adviser to the Indian government. Her career includes stints as an additional secretary in the External Affairs Ministry and a counsellor at India's UN Mission. She is a legal consultant to the Indian Government and has experience of ITLOS from the outside of the bench. She successfully represented the country before the tribunal in the case brought by Italy demanding the release of two of its marines charged by India with killing two Indian fishermen. The tribunal refused to order the release of the Indian fishermen. In the maritime borders dispute between India and Bangladesh, she represented New Delhi at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. The verdict awarding Bangladesh 19,467 sq.km of the contested area in the Bay of Bengal was a victory for Dhaka.Neeru has also represented India in a frivolous case brought in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The case was brought up by the Marshall Islands over what it said was New Delhi's failure to end the nuclear race. The ICJ dismissed the Marshall Island's case.She holds a degree from the University of Michigan Law School. The other judges of the tribunals are Elsa Kelly of Argentina and Liesbeth Lijnzaad of the Netherlands. They were elected with Neeru Chadha on Wednesday. Kriangsak Kittichaisaree of Thailand was elected by the Asia Pacific Group in the second round of voting.In elections to another international legal post, Aniruddha Rajput was elected by the UN General Assembly to the International Law Commission last November.Judge Dalveer Bhandari's term ends next February at the International Court of Justice.

Sentencing is scheduled for July 9.According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court, agents for the Department of Homeland Security Investigations received information that a smuggling operation run by Patel was attempting to find methods to bring foreign nationals from India into the US.The investigation revealed that the smuggling organisation recruited Indian nationals and others to pay fees in exchange for passage to the US.Beginning in October 2013, an undercover law enforcement officer posing as a smuggler began meeting with Patel in Bangkok. Patel told the undercover law enforcement officer that he wanted to smuggle Indian nationals into the US.On three different occasions, Patel or his conspirator transported the Indian nationals to an airport in Thailand, at which point the undercover law enforcement officer would presumably use his contacts to smuggle them into the US via commercial airline flights, the Department of Justice said.Patel agreed to wire down payments for each individual to be smuggled and to pay a balance of tens of thousands of dollars for each individual once the foreign nationals arrived in the US.Over the ensuing months, Patel arranged for six Indian nationals to be brought to Thailand for smuggling into the US via Newark Liberty International Airport. He was arrested on December 7, 2018, upon his arrival at Newark Liberty."

Pakistan believes that the new government in India after the general elections would be more receptive to Khan's offer of peace talks.When asked about the prospects of resumption of talks given the current hostilities, the official said Pakistan was optimistic. The reason for this optimism stems from the fact that new government, whether it is formed by the ruling BJP or the Congress, is unlikely to follow the pre-election rhetoric, he said.One of the options include the appointment of the NSA to revive the backchannel with India.  In the past, the two countries often used backchannel through the NSAs to prepare ground for any talks.In 2015, Pakistan's NSA Lt General (retd) Naseer Khan Janjua and his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval were instrumental in breaking the ice.  The two held meetings in Bangkok leading to the agreement between the two foreign ministers for the resumption of the composite dialogue.The leadership of the two countries used their respective NSAs to communicate on important issues.Talking to foreign journalists last month, Khan had said that there might be a better chance of peace talks with India if Modi returned to power. ""If the next Indian government is led by the opposition Congress party, it might be too scared to seek a settlement with Pakistan over Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK), fearing a backlash from the right,"" the prime minister told a small group of foreign journalists in an interview.""Perhaps if the BJP – a right wing party — wins, some kind of settlement on Kashmir could be reached.""Khan's statement stirred a heated debate both in Pakistan as well as in India, where Modi's opponents mocked him as Pakistan's ally. In Pakistan, opposition parties criticised Khan for making an 'undiplomatic statement' and also supporting Modi despite his hostile policies."

These patients had used strong anticholinergic medication daily for three years or more. Anticholinergic drugs help to contract and relax muscles. They are prescribed to treat a variety of conditions including, allergies, gastrointestinal disorders, bladder conditions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and symptoms of Parkinson's disease. According to the research published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, out of the 58,769 patients with dementia, 63 per cent were women. The average age of the patients was 82. The research indicates that anti-cholinergic drugs should be prescribed with caution in middle-aged and older patients.""The risks of this type of medication should be carefully considered by healthcare professionals alongside the benefits when the drugs are prescribed and alternative treatments should be considered where possible, such as other types of antidepressants or alternative types of treatment for bladder conditions,"" said Carol Coupland, a professor at University of Nottingham.""These findings also highlight the importance of carrying out regular medication reviews,"" Coupland said. According to the researchers, the study is observational, so no firm conclusions can be drawn about whether these anticholinergic drugs cause dementia.It is possible that the drugs were being prescribed for very early symptoms of dementia, researchers said. In the 1-11 years before the dementia diagnosis date or equivalent in controls, nearly 57 per cent of cases and 51 per cent of controls were prescribed at least one strong anticholinergic drug, with an average of six prescriptions in cases and 4 in controls. The most frequently-prescribed types of drugs were antidepressants, anti-vertigo and bladder antimuscarinic drugs -- which are used to treat an overactive bladder. ALSO READ | Special Report: How drugs addiction impacting youth in Jammu and Kashmir ALSO READ | Delhi: 8 arrested as police bust rave party in Mehrauli; drugs, alcohol seized "

It did not include an agreement to take steps toward ending the technical state of warfare between the US and North Korea.The pair promised in the document to “build a lasting and stable peace regime” on the Korean Peninsula and to repatriate remains of prisoners of war and those missing in action during the Korean War.Also read | Trump-Kim Singapore Summit - AS IT HAPPENEDNews photographers captured photos of the broad, two-page agreement, which was not immediately released by the White House.The formal document signing followed a series of meetings at a luxury Singapore resort.Meeting with staged ceremony on a Singapore island, Trump and Kim came together for a summit that seemed just unthinkable months ago, clasping hands in front of a row of alternating US and North Korean flags, holding a one-on-one meeting, additional talks with advisers and a working lunch.Image Source : APUS President Donald Trump shakes hands with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un at the Capella resort on Sentosa Island on TuesdayUS President Donald Trump shakes hands with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un at the Capella resort on Sentosa Island on TuesdayThroughout the summit that could chart the course for historic peace or raise the specter of a growing nuclear threat, both leaders expressed optimism. Kim called the sit-down a “good prelude for peace” and Trump pledged that “working together we will get it taken care of.”At the signing ceremony, Trump said he expected to “meet many times” in the future with Kim. Responding to questions, he said “absolutely” he would invite Kim to the White House.For his part, Kim hailed the “historic meeting” and said they “decided to leave the past behind.”In a moment that would have never happened in North Korea, reporters began yelling questions to Trump and Kim, including whether they had discussed the case of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who suffered brain damage while in North Korean custody and died in June 2017, days after he was returned home to Ohio.In the run-up to the meeting, Trump had predicted the two men might strike a nuclear deal or forge a formal end to the Korean War in the course of a single meeting or over several days. But in the hours before the summit, the White House unexpectedly announced Trump would depart Singapore earlier than expected — Tuesday evening — raising questions about whether his aspirations for an ambitious outcome had been scaled back.The meeting was the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader.Aware that the eyes of the world were on a moment many people never expected to see, Kim said many of those watching would think it was a scene from a “science fiction movie.”Also read | Timeline: How the Donald Trump-Kim Jong un summit came togetherAfter meeting privately and with aides, Trump and Kim moved into the luncheon at a long flower-bedecked table. As they entered, Trump injected some levity to the day’s extraordinary events, saying: “Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.”Then they dined on beef short rib confit along with sweet and sour crispy pork.And as they emerged from the meal for a brief stroll together, Trump appeared to delight in showing his North Korean counterpart the interior of “The Beast,” the famed US presidential limousine known for its high-tech fortifications.Critics of the summit leapt at the leaders’ handshake and the moonlight stroll Kim took Monday night along the glittering Singapore waterfront, saying it was further evidence that Trump was helping legitimize Kim on the world stage as an equal of the US president. Kim has been accused of horrific rights abuses against his people.“It’s a huge win for Kim Jong Un, who now — if nothing else — has the prestige and propaganda coup of meeting one on one with the president, while armed with a nuclear deterrent,” said Michael Kovrig, a northeast Asia specialist at the International Crisis Group in Washington.Trump responded to such commentary on Twitter, saying: “The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the US, say the haters & losers.” But he added “our hostages” are back home and testing, research and launches have stopped.Giving voice to the anticipation felt around the world as the meeting opened, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Tuesday he “hardly slept” before the summit. Moon and other officials watched the live broadcast of the summit before a South Korean Cabinet meeting in his presidential officeThe summit capped a dizzying few days of foreign policy activity for Trump, who shocked US allies over the weekend by using a meeting in Canada of the Group of Seven industrialized economies to alienate America’s closest friends in the West. Lashing out over trade practices, Trump lobbed insults at his G-7 host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump left that summit early and, as he flew to Singapore, tweeted that he was yanking the US out of the group’s traditional closing statement.The optimistic summit was a remarkable change in dynamics from less than a year ago, when Trump was threatening “fire and fury” against Kim, who in turn scorned the American president as a “mentally deranged US dotard.” Beyond the impact on both leaders’ political fortunes, the summit could shape the fate of countless people — the citizens of impoverished North Korea, the tens of millions living in the shadow of the North’s nuclear threat, and millions more worldwide.Alluding to the North’s concerns that giving up its nuclear weapons could surrender its primary deterrent to forced regime change, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that the US was prepared to take action to provide North Korea with “sufficient certainty” that denuclearization “is not something that ends badly for them.”He would not say whether that included the possibility of withdrawing US troops from the Korean Peninsula, but said the US was “prepared to take what will be security assurances that are different, unique, than America’s been willing to provide previously.”The North has faced crippling diplomatic and economic sanctions as it has advanced development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Pompeo held firm to Trump’s position that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea denuclearises — and said they would even increase if diplomatic discussions did not progress positively.Experts believe the North is close to being able to target the entire US mainland with its nuclear-armed missiles, and while there’s deep skepticism that Kim will quickly give up those hard-won nukes, there’s also some hope that diplomacy can replace the animosity between the US and the North.Watch video: "

48213d869ab8641fe6450ad1bf02a74e,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong said that North Korea is willing to resume talks with South Korea if it lifts hostility on her country.The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Friday her country is willing to resume talks with South Korea if it doesn’t provoke the North with hostile policies and double standards.Kim Yo Jong’s statement was a response to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s renewed calls for a declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War as a way to bring back peace. Her proposal also came days after North Korea performed its first missile tests in six months and South Korea performed its first test of a submarine-launched missile.“If (South) Korea distances itself from the past when it provoked us and criticized us at every step with its double standards and restores sincerity in its words and actions and abandons its hostility, we would then be willing to resume close communication and engage in constructive discussions about restoring and developing relations,” Kim Yo Jong said.To achieve the end-of-the war declaration, she said: “We must ensure mutual respect toward one another and abandon prejudiced views, harshly hostile policies and unfair double standards toward the other side first.”Her comments were a contrast to a blunt statement by a senior North Korean diplomat earlier Friday that the end-of-war declaration could be used as a “smokescreen covering up the U.S. hostile policy” against the North.Vice Foreign Minister Ri Thae Song American weapons and troops deployed in South Korea and its vicinity and regular U.S. military drills in the region “all point to the U.S. hostile policy toward (North Korea) getting vicious day by day.” North Korea has also long described U.S.-led economic sanctions as proof of U.S. hostility against the North.In a response to Ri’s statement, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said it’ll continue its efforts to adopt the end-of-the war declaration and strengthen cooperation with related countries. Cha Duck Chul, a deputy ministry spokesman, said declaring the war’s end would be “a very meaningful step” as it could be a starting point for peace negotiations and denuclearization on the peninsula.The Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving the peninsula in a technical state of war. North Korea has steadily wanted to sign a peace treaty with the United States to formally end the war and for subsequent improved relations. Some experts say the peace treaty could allow North Korea to demand the United States to withdraw its 28,500 troops in South Korea and ease sanctions.Both Koreas had called for an end-of-war declaration to be made and a peace treaty to be signed during the period of diplomacy with the United States that began in 2018, and there was speculation then-President Donald Trump might announce the war’s end in early 2019 to convince North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to commit to denuclearization.No such announcement was made as the diplomacy faded to a stalemate over easing the sanctions in return for North Korea denuclearizing. In late 2019, North Korea said the nuclear crisis won’t be resolved if the United States sought to persuade it to return to the talks with a proposal on the war-end declaration without withdrawing its hostile policy.In recent months, Kim has warned that North Korea would bolster its nuclear arsenal and introduce more sophisticated weapons systems unless the United States drops its hostile policy. Last week, North Korea conducted its first cruise and ballistic missile tests since March, demonstrating its ability to launch attacks on South Korea and Japan, two key U.S. allies where a total of 80,000 American soldiers are stationed."

The verdict was announced after the government submitted a new ""summary"" to extend the service of 59-year-old Gen Bajwa. The ruling came in the nick of time as Gen Bajwa was set to retire at midnight Thursday.""The court order has helped the government come out of the corner it had painted itself into by its inept handling of the issue. The government is chiefly to blame for this needless confusion and controversy over a sensitive matter,"" it commented on the Khan-led government that has been in office for over one year now.""It is therefore disappointing to note the prime minister's tweets blaming foreign enemies and domestic ""mafia"" whereas the real culprit is the government's own legal team that was unable to write a notification that could withstand judicial scrutiny,"" the editorial said.Given the central role played by army chiefs in Pakistan, and their crucial position within the state structure, Parliament must come up with legislation that stands the test of time, it said.""The sheer incompetence of the government and the mistakes it made, like racing through the original notification and appearing unclear about the provisions of the Army Act and Army Rules, did not help win it much credibility,"" an editorial in The News International said.""In an environment in which we as citizens have learned to accept without question all decisions, particularly when it comes to powerful institutions, this case acquires historic significance,"" it noted.Till now, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government has shown little interest in Parliament. This may have to change if it is to meet the court's condition of drafting and passing a new law within the next six months, it said.The paper also noted that prime minister Khan's tweet on Thursday, attacking the Opposition once again, is certainly not good politics at a time when their cooperation will be required.The Nation's editorial pointed out that the Supreme Court has showed a way out of the mess the bumbling PTI government has created for itself.""It is incomprehensible that a notification regarding the extension of the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff, possibly the most important document of its day, found itself subject to amateurish butchery,"" the paper said.The apex court noted that in the three days of court proceedings, the government kept changing its stance, interchangeably ""referring to it as reappointment, limiting of retirement or extension of tenure"".The editorial said the ""people of Pakistan were left marvelling at a botched operation, the likes of which we have never seen before."" ""Confidence in the government rightly stands at an all-time low, and if this episode displays their maximum competence, then one worries greatly of their ability to understand matters of national security at all,"" it said.The newspaper also criticised Khan, the cricketer-turned-politician for his tweets soon after the Supreme Court allowed Gen Bajwa to continue in office for six more months.""What added to the triumph of absolute incapability in the government; was a tweet by the Prime Minister himself, where he once again repeated an incomprehensible mumbo jumbo about a ""mafia"" and ""looted wealth"" being responsible for the state of affairs,"" The Nation commented.""Mercifully, we are out of the crisis — at least for now,"" an editorial in The Express Tribune said.It must have been a revelation for many — even lawmakers and law experts — that the Constitution does not carry a single provision to support an extension in the tenure of the country's top soldier, the paper said.Business Recorder in an editorial emphasised that had the apex court chosen to, it could have created even more embarrassment for the government and the army.""Leaning on the side of caution so as not to make matters worse and possibly create a constitutional/political crisis, the Supreme Court wisely chose a middle path that helped extricate the fumbling government from the self-created maze it seemed trapped in and avoided any vacuum of leadership in the army,"" it said.Now the ball is in the government's court. How it proceeds from here on in this sensitive matter could either salvage something from the wreckage of its foolish and incompetent performance or reinforce the image of it being not quite up to the task of governance, the leading business newspaper commented."

6132573e0272033082dd7f0ffc262871,"US inflation at 40-year high pressures consumersInflation jumped at its fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month, a 7% spike from a year earlier that is increasing household expenses, eating into wage gains and heaping pressure on US President Joe Biden and the Federal Reserve to address what has become the biggest threat to the US economy.Prices rose sharply in 2021 for cars, gas, food and furniture as part of a rapid recovery from the pandemic recession. Vast infusions of government aid and ultra-low interest rates helped spur demand for goods, while vaccinations gave people the confidence to dine out and travel.As Americans ramped up spending, supply chains remained squeezed by shortages of workers and raw materials and this magnified price pressures.The Labor Department reported Wednesday that a measure of inflation that excludes volatile food and gas prices jumped 5.5% in December, also the highest in decades. Overall inflation rose 0.5% from November, down from 0.8% the previous month.Price gains could slow further as snags in supply chains ease, but most economists say inflation won’t fall back to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon.“U.S. inflation pressures show no sign of easing,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at the financial services company ING. “It hasn’t been this high since the days of Thatcher and Reagan. We could be close to the peak, but the risk is that inflation stays higher for longer.’’High inflation isn’t only a problem for the US. In the 19 European countries that use the euro currency, inflation rose 5% in December compared with a year earlier, the biggest increase on record.Companies large and small are adapting as best they can.Nicole Pomije, a bakery owner in the Minneapolis area, said she plans to raise prices for cookies because of surging ingredient costs.Her basic cookies were priced at 99 cents each, while premium versions were selling for $1.50 each. But Pomije said she will have to jack up the prices of her basic cookies to the premium price.“We have to make money,” she said. “We don’t want to lose our customers. But I think we might.”Businesses struggling to hire have hiked pay, but rising prices for goods and services have eroded those income gains for many Americans. Lower-income families have felt it the most, and polls show that inflation has started displacing even the coronavirus as a public concern.The United States hasn’t seen anything like it since the early 1980s. Back then, Fed Chair Paul Volcker responded by pushing interest rates to painful levels — the prime rate for banks’ best customers hit 20% in 1980 — and sent the economy into a deep recession. But Volcker succeeded in taming inflation that had been running at double-digit year-over-year levels for much of 1979-1981.High inflation has put President Biden on the defensive. His administration, echoing officials at the Fed, initially suggested that price increases would be temporary. Now that inflation has persisted, Biden and some congressional Democrats have begun to blame large corporations. They say meat producers and other industries are taking advantage of pandemic-induced shortages to drive up prices and profits. But even some left-of-center economists disagree with that diagnosis.On Wednesday, the president issued a statement arguing that the drop in gas prices in December and a smaller increase in food costs showed progress.One trend experts fear is a wage-price spiral. That happens when workers seek more pay to offset higher costs, and then companies raise costs further to cover that higher pay. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a Senate panel that he has yet to see evidence that wages are broadly driving up prices across the economy.The biggest driver of inflation, according to economists, are mismatches between supply and demand. Used car prices have soared more than 37% over the past year because a shortage of semiconductors has prevented auto companies from making enough new cars. Supply-chain constraints have driven furniture prices nearly 14% higher over the past year.Shoppers are feeling the pinch all around them, from the gas station to the grocery store.Vicki Bernardo Hill, 65, an occupational therapist in Gaithersburg, Maryland, says she no longer throws extra canned food, boxes of cereal or bakery items into her shopping cart at the Giant Food store.“I am trying to stick to my list and buying things that are on sale, ” said Hill.Because she couldn’t find a good deal on a used car, Hill recently bought a new Mazda, spending $5,000 more than she had planned.Inflation could ease as the omicron wave fades and as Americans shift more of their spending to services such as travel, eating out and movie-going. That would reduce the demand for goods and help clear supply chains.But some higher prices, such as rents, could prove to be stickier. Rental costs, which have accelerated since summer, rose 0.4% in December, the third consecutive monthly increase. That’s significant because housing costs make up one-third of the government’s consumer price index.Powell told Congress that if it becomes necessary to fight high inflation more aggressively, the Federal Reserve is prepared to accelerate the interest rate hikes it plans to begin this year. The Fed’s benchmark short-term rate, now pegged near zero, is expected to be bumped up at least three times this year.Rate increases would make borrowing for a home or car more expensive, and therefore help to cool off the economy.Some economists and members of Congress fear the Fed has acted too slowly to head off inflation and that this could eventually force even sharper rate increases that could damage the economy.Republicans in Congress and even some liberal economists say Biden deserves at least some of the blame for high inflation, arguing that the financial rescue package he pushed through Congress last March added significant stimulus to an already strengthening economy.Also Read | "
a30bd0904bed768bb5179055bbc28c07,"Vienna Terror Attack: 2 killed, 15 injured as gunmen open fire at 6 different locations in ViennaGunmen opened fire on people enjoying a last night out at Vienna’s cafes and restaurants before a coronavirus lockdown Monday in what authorities said was a terrorist attack that left at least two dead — including one of the assailants — and 15 wounded.“We are victims of a despicable terror attack in the federal capital that is still ongoing,” Austria’s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said hours after the gunfire erupted.“One of the perpetrators was neutralized, but several perpetrators appear to still be on the loose,” he said. “They seem to also, as far as we know, be very well equipped, with automatic weapons. So they were very well prepared.”Police said that several shots were fired shortly after 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) on a lively street in the city center and that there were six shooting locations. Unverified footage on social media showed gunmen walking through the streets, apparently shooting at people at random, wounding several.The motive was under investigation, but Kurz said the possibility it was an anti-Semitic attack cannot be ruled out, given that the shooting began outside Vienna’s main synagogue. It was closed at the time.Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said the army had been asked to guard key locations in the city as hundreds of heavily armed police hunted for the gunmen. He urged people in Vienna to stay indoors and avoid the city center and encouraged parents not to send their children to school on Tuesday.Kurz praised police for killing one of the attackers and vowed: “We will not never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism and will fight these attacks with all means.”Vienna Mayor Michael Ludwig said 15 people were hospitalized, seven with serious injuries.Oskar Deutsch, the head of the Jewish community in Vienna, said it was not clear whether the main synagogue had been targeted.Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least one person shoot at people sitting outside at bars in the street below his window.“They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,” Hofmeister said.“All these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown,” he added. “As of midnight, all bars and restaurants will be closed in Austria for the next month, and a lot of people probably wanted to use that evening to be able to go out.”French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that the French “share the shock and grief of the Austrian people hit by an attack tonight.”“After France, this is a friendly country that has been attacked. This is our Europe. ... We will not give in,” he wrote.France has endured three attacks blamed on Muslim extremists in recent weeks: the wounding of two people outside satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo’s old headquarters; the beheading of a schoolteacher who showed students caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad; and a deadly knife attack Thursday in a church in the Mediterranean city of Nice.All of the attacks were strongly condemned at the time by Austria’s chancellor."

The patient is a Chinese woman in her 40s who arrived in Sri Lanka last week as a tourist from China’s Hubei province, said Dr. Sudath Samaraweera, chief epidemiologist of the country’s health ministry.The woman was suffering from a fever when she was admitted Saturday to the island nation’s Infectious Disease Hospital, a state-run facility that treats people suffering from potentially deadly infectious diseases.Sri Lanka became a major travel destination for Chinese tourists in recent years.

8c9f4b8e4160bf2ffca30550d4feb6b1,"Taliban leader Mullah Nooruddin Turabi one of the founders of the Taliban, says the hard-line movement will once again carry out punishments like executions and amputations of hands, though perhaps not in public. One of the founders of the Taliban and the chief enforcer of its harsh interpretation of Islamic law when they last ruled Afghanistan said the hard-line movement will once again carry out executions and amputations of hands, though perhaps not in public.In an interview with The Associated Press, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi dismissed outrage over the Taliban’s executions in the past, which sometimes took place in front of crowds at a stadium, and he warned the world against interfering with Afghanistan’s new rulers.“Everyone criticized us for the punishments in the stadium, but we have never said anything about their laws and their punishments,” Turabi told The Associated Press, speaking in Kabul. “No one will tell us what our laws should be. We will follow Islam and we will make our laws on the Quran.”Since the Taliban overran Kabul on Aug. 15 and seized control of the country, Afghans and the world have been watching to see whether they will re-create their harsh rule of the late 1990s. Turabi’s comments pointed to how the group’s leaders remain entrenched in a deeply conservative, hard-line worldview, even if they are embracing technological changes, like video and mobile phones.Turabi, now in his early 60s, was justice minister and head of the so-called Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice — effectively, the religious police — during the Taliban’s previous rule.At that time, the world denounced the Taliban’s punishments, which took place in Kabul’s sports stadium or on the grounds of the sprawling Eid Gah mosque, often attended by hundreds of Afghan men.Executions of convicted murderers were usually by a single shot to the head, carried out by the victim’s family, who had the option of accepting “blood money” and allowing the culprit to live. For convicted thieves, the punishment was amputation of a hand. For those convicted of highway robbery, a hand and a foot were amputated.Trials and convictions were rarely public and the judiciary was weighted in favor of Islamic clerics, whose knowledge of the law was limited to religious injunctions.Turabi said that this time, judges — including women — would adjudicate cases, but the foundation of Afghanistan’s laws will be the Quran. He said the same punishments would be revived.“Cutting off of hands is very necessary for security,” he said, saying it had a deterrent effect. He said the Cabinet was studying whether to do punishments in public and will “develop a policy.”In recent days in Kabul, Taliban fighters have revived a punishment they commonly used in the past — public shaming of men accused of small-time theft.On at least two occasions in the last week, Kabul men have been packed into the back of a pickup truck, their hands tied, and were paraded around to humiliate them. In one case, their faces were painted to identify them as thieves. In the other, stale bread was hung from their necks or stuffed in their mouth. It wasn’t immediately clear what their crimes were.Wearing a white turban and a bushy, unkempt white beard, the stocky Turabi limped slightly on his artificial leg. He lost a leg and one eye during fighting with Soviet troops in the 1980s.Under the new Taliban government, he is in charge of prisons. He is among a number of Taliban leaders, including members of the all-male interim Cabinet, who are on a United Nations sanctions list.During the previous Taliban rule, he was one of the group’s most ferocious and uncompromising enforcers. When the Taliban took power in 1996, one of his first acts was to scream at a woman journalist, demanding she leave a room of men, and to then deal a powerful slap in the face of a man who objected.Turabi was notorious for ripping music tapes from cars, stringing up hundreds of meters of destroyed cassettes in trees and signposts. He demanded men wear turbans in all government offices and his minions routinely beat men whose beards had been trimmed. Sports were banned, and Turabi’s legion of enforcers forced men to the mosque for prayers five times daily.In this week’s interview with the AP, Turabi spoke to a woman journalist.“We are changed from the past,” he said.He said now the Taliban would allow television, mobile phones, photos and video “because this is the necessity of the people, and we are serious about it.” He suggested that the Taliban saw the media as a way to spread their message. “Now we know instead of reaching just hundreds, we can reach millions,” he said. He added that if punishments are made public, then people may be allowed to video or take photos to spread the deterrent effect.The U.S. and its allies have been trying to use the threat of isolation — and the economic damage that would result from it — to pressure the Taliban to moderate their rule and give other factions, minorities and women a place in power.But Turabi dismissed criticism over the previous Taliban rule, arguing that it had succeeded in bringing stability. “We had complete safety in every part of the country,” he said of the late 1990s.Even as Kabul residents express fear over their new Taliban rulers, some acknowledge grudgingly that the capital has already become safer in just the past month. Before the Taliban takeover, bands of thieves roamed the streets, and relentless crime had driven most people off the streets after dark.“It’s not a good thing to see these people being shamed in public, but it stops the criminals because when people see it, they think ‘I don’t want that to be me,’” said Amaan, a store owner in the center of Kabul. He asked to be identified by just one name.Another shopkeeper said it was a violation of human rights but that he was also happy he can open his store after dark.ALSO READ: Afghan aid operations expand, but most people still hungry: United Nations"

Therefore, the federal government should take all necessary steps to save national crops and provide required resources to the quarters concerned,"" Khan was quoted as saying in the report.Bakhtiar informed the house that it was for the first time that after attacking Sindh and Punjab, the swarms of locust had entered Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.""A sum of Rs 7.3 bn is required to avoid further destruction,"" he said.""Declaration of national emergency eminent to handle the situation; besides, Parliament must have a role in monitoring the situation,"" he added.Bakhtiar claimed that the government had managed to save cotton and winter crops to a large extent, adding that climate change was one of the reasons for delay in the exit of locusts. He said the situation was worse than the one Pakistan faced in 1993.The swarms of locust are currently on the Pakistan-India border along Cholistan, the minister said, adding that insects had entered Cholistan and Nara from Sindh and Balochistan.Locusts used to move to Iran after sometime, but perhaps this time due to low temperatures they are still in Pakistan, he said.Nawab Yousuf Talpur of Pakistan Peoples Party said that in 1993 when locusts had attacked the country, the situation had been handled in four days with limited resources, the report said. Also Read: Pakistani judge accused of raping woman in his private chamberAlso Read: Pakistan: 2 polio vaccinators shot dead by gunmen"

It said it has sold more than 25,000 ""unification moisture nuclear masks"" since June, the BBC reported.Many South Korean stores, though, halted the sales amid a public backlash and concerns over the masks' legality.In South Korea it is illegal to speak favourably of the North Korean government, though the law is rarely enforced. Dozens of Koreans have posted pictures of themselves on social media with the masks, which cost 4,000 won, the BBC said.Propaganda-style slogans claim the masks contain mineral water from Mount Paektu, the sacred, active volcano, which is the birthplace of Dangun, founder of the first Korean kingdom more than 4,000 years ago, according to Korean mythology.""Personally, I don't like merchandise promoting a certain political agenda,"" Irene Kim, a South Korean skincare expert, told the South China Morning Post.""A few years ago, North Korea was the largest threat to our country… Kim Jong-un was seen as a dictator and a tyrant who would stop at nothing to disrupt world peace, now he's become the face of a popular face mask,"" she added.The North Korean leader and his regime have been criticised by the UN for ""systematic, widespread"" human rights abuses.Both North and South Korea are still technically at war, but leaders from both countries attended talks this year over denuclearisation.In an interview with the New York Times, 5149 CEO Kwak Hyeon-ju said she wanted the masks to celebrate the ""once in a lifetime"" Korean summits held earlier this year.Kim has led North Korea since the death of its former dictator, his father Kim Jong-il, in 2011.The country's communist regime has been criticised by the UN and human rights groups for ""systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations""."
f4a4d44b9c2c6cf3cdebc740f8e0d0a4,"Earth is likely to hit more dangerous levels of warming even sooner if the U.S. pulls back from its pledge to cut carbon dioxide pollution, scientists said. That’s because America contributes so much to rising temperatures.President Donald Trump, who once proclaimed global warming a Chinese hoax, will soon decide whether the United States stays in or leaves a 2015 Paris climate change accord in which nearly every nation agreed to curb its greenhouse gas emissions.Other global leaders have been urging him to stay during high level security and economic meetings in Italy that began Friday. Pope Francis already made the case with a gift of his papal encyclical on the environment when Trump visited the Vatican earlier this week.In an attempt to understand what could happen to the planet if the U.S. pulls out of Paris, The Associated Press consulted with more than two dozen climate scientists and analyzed a special computer model scenario designed to calculate potential effects.Scientists said it would worsen an already bad problem, and make it far more difficult to prevent crossing a dangerous global temperature threshold.Calculations suggest it could result in emissions of up to 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the air a year. When it adds up year after year, scientists said that is enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather.“If we lag, the noose tightens,” said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, co-editor of the peer-reviewed journal Climatic Change.One expert group ran a worst-case computer simulation of what would happen if the U.S. does not curb emissions, but other nations do meet their targets. It found that America would add as much as half a degree of warming (0.3 degrees Celsius) to the globe by the end of century.Scientists are split on how reasonable and likely that scenario is.Many said because of cheap natural gas that displaces coal and growing adoption of renewable energy sources, it is unlikely that the U.S. would stop reducing its carbon pollution even if it abandoned the accord, so the effect would likely be smaller.But others say it could be worse because other countries might follow a U.S. exit, leading to more emissions from both the U.S. and the rest.Another computer simulation team put the effect of the U.S. pulling out somewhere between 0.1 to 0.2 degrees Celsius (.18 to .36 degrees Fahrenheit).While scientists may disagree on the computer simulations they overwhelmingly agreed that the warming the planet is undergoing now would be faster and more intense.The world without U.S. efforts would have a far more difficult time avoiding a dangerous threshold: keeping the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.The world has already warmed by just over half that amount — with about one-fifth of the past heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions coming from the United States, usually from the burning of coal, oil and gas.So the efforts are really about preventing another 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) from now.“Developed nations — particularly the U.S. and Europe — are responsible for the lion’s share of past emissions, with China now playing a major role,” said Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis. “This means Americans have caused a large fraction of the warming.”Even with the U.S. doing what it promised under the Paris agreement, the world is likely to pass that 2 degree mark, many scientists said.But the fractions of additional degrees that the U.S. would contribute could mean passing the threshold faster, which could in turn mean “ecosystems being out of whack with the climate, trouble farming current crops and increasing shortages of food and water,” said National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Kevin Trenberth.Climate Interactive, a team of scientists and computer modelers who track global emissions and pledges, simulated global emissions if every country but the U.S. reaches their individualized goals to curb carbon pollution. And then they calculated what that would mean in global temperature, sea level rise and ocean acidification using scientifically-accepted computer models.By the year 2030, it would mean an extra 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide in the air a year, according to the Climate Interactive models, and by the end of the century 0.3 degrees Celsius of warming.“The U.S. matters a great deal,” said Climate Interactive co-director Andrew Jones. “That amount could make the difference between meeting the Paris limit of two degrees and missing it.”Climate Action Tracker, a competing computer simulation team, put the effect of the U.S. pulling out somewhere between 0.1 to 0.2 degrees Celsius (.18 to .36 Fahrenheit) by 2100. It uses a scenario where U.S. emissions flatten through the century, while Climate Interactive has them rising.One of the few scientists who downplay the harm of the U.S. possibly leaving the agreement is John Schellnhuber, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the scientist credited with coming up with the 2 degree goal.“Ten years ago (a U.S. exit) would have shocked the planet,” Schellnhuber said. “Today if the U.S. really chooses to leave the Paris agreement, the world will move on with building a clean and secure future.”Not so, said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe: “There will be ripple effects from the United States’ choices across the world.”"

Tropical Storm Eta passed just off the coast of Pinellas County with torrential rain and storm surge. Eta dumped torrents of blustery rain on Florida's west coast as it moved over Florida after making landfall north of the heavily populated Tampa Bay area Thursday morning. Just as the remnants of Eta finally blew out to sea on Friday, another storm formed that could follow its path of death and destruction into Central America this weekend.Hurricane experts were closely watching the Caribbean, where Tropical Storm Iota formed Friday afternoon. Forecasters warned that Iota could power up quickly, to major hurricane strength, as it approaches Central America late Sunday or Monday, and wreak more havoc in a region where people are still grappling with the aftermath of Eta.The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Iota could bring dangerous wind, storm surge and as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall to northern Nicaragua and Honduras. The storm was located about 350 miles (560 kilometers) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica and had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph). There were no coastal warnings or watches in effect as of Friday afternoon.Iota is a record-setting 30th named storm of this year’s extraordinarily busy Atlantic hurricane season. Such activity has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.In terms of Eta, forecasters said its remnants would pick up forward speed in the next day or so as it pulls away from the Southeast seaboard. Eta also triggered flash flooding, water rescues and at least one bridge collapse in South Carolina, said Sandy LaCorte, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Greenville, South Carolina.Eta hit Nicaragua last week as a Category 4 hurricane, killing at least 120 people as torrential rains brought flash floods and landslides to parts of Central America and Mexico. Then it meandered across Cuba, the Florida Keys and around the Gulf of Mexico before slogging ashore again near Cedar Key, Florida, and dashing across Florida and the Carolinas.The Tampa Bay area was buffeted with gusty winds and rain, and there was one U.S. death linked to Eta: In Bradenton Beach, Mark Mixon stepped into his flooded garage as he was laying sandbags around his home Wednesday evening and was electrocuted, said Jacob Saur, director of public safety for Manatee County.Earlier, firefighters in Tampa had to rescue around a dozen people who got stuck in storm surge flooding on a boulevard adjacent to the bay. Some vehicles remained on the roadway Thursday. Isolated neighborhoods also experienced enough flooding to evacuate.Several sailboats broke free from their moorings and washed ashore in Gulfport, Florida, including the vessel where Mo Taggart has lived for two years with her dog. She thinks the boat is a total loss.“I mean, it was a disaster,” Taggart said. “I mean, I came out here. My boat’s just up against the seawall, just smashing, smashing ... I need to get another boat. I want to be back on the water, (my dog) wants to be back on the water.”Eta was the 28th named storm of this year’s hurricane season, tying the 2005 record for named storms. Theta, the 29th, was centered Friday night south-southeast of the Azores, and moving east with top sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph)."

And the few people who live here — its whole population wouldn’t fill a football stadium — are poor, with a high rate of substance abuse and suicide.One scientist called it the “end of the planet.”Image Source : APGreenland's settlementsGreenland's settlementsWhen U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of buying Greenland, it was met with derision, seen as an awkward and inappropriate approach of an erstwhile ally.But it might also be an Aladdin’s Cave of oil, natural gas and rare earth minerals just waiting to be tapped as the ice recedes.The northern island and the rest of the Arctic aren’t just hotter due to global warming. As melting ice opens shipping lanes and reveals incredible riches, the region is seen as a new geopolitical and economic asset, with the U.S., Russia, China and others wanting in.Image Source : APGreenland is Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realGreenland is Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is real“An independent Greenland could, for example, offer basing rights to either Russia or China or both,” said Fen Hampson, the former head of the international security program at the Centre for International Governance Innovation think tank in Waterloo, Ontario, who is now a professor at Carleton University.He noted the desire by some there to secede as a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.Image Source : APGreenland is Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realGreenland is Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is real“I am not saying this would happen, but it is a scenario that would have major geostrategic implications, especially if the Northwest Passage becomes a transit route for shipping, which is what is happening in the Russian Arctic.”In April, Russian President Vladimir Putin put forward an ambitious program to reaffirm his country’s presence in the Arctic, including efforts to build ports and other infrastructure and expand its icebreaker fleet. Russia wants to stake its claim in the region that is believed to hold up to one-fourth of the Earth’s undiscovered oil and gas.Image Source : APGreenland in Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realGreenland in Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realChina sees Greenland as a possible source of rare earths and other minerals and a port for shipping through the Arctic to the eastern U.S. It called last year for joint development of a “Polar Silk Road” as part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative to build railways, ports and other facilities in dozens of countries.But while global warming pushes the cold and ice farther north each year, experts caution that the race to the Arctic is an incredibly challenging marathon, not a sprint.The melting of the Greenland ice sheet creates uncertainty and danger for offshore oil and gas developers, threatening rigs and ships.“All that ice doesn’t suddenly melt; it creates icebergs that you have to navigate around,” said Victoria Herrmann, managing director of the Arctic Institute, a nonprofit focused on Arctic security.Image Source : APGreenland in Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realGreenland in Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realOn the other hand, while mining in Greenland has been expensive due to the environment, development costs have fallen as the ice has melted, making it more attractive to potential buyers, she said.Strategically, Greenland forms part of what the U.S. views as a key corridor for naval operations between the Arctic and the North Atlantic. It is also part of the broader Arctic region, considered strategically important because of its proximity to the U.S. and economically vital for its natural resources.Hampson noted it was an American protectorate during World War II, when Nazi Germany occupied Denmark, and the U.S. was allowed to build radar stations and rent-free bases on its territory after the war.

The U.S. also thought about buying Greenland 80 years earlier.Trump “may not be as crazy as he sounds despite his ham-fisted offer, which clearly upset the Danes, and rightly so,” Hampson said.Greenland is part of the Danish realm along with the Faeroe Islands, another semi-autonomous territory, and has its own government and parliament. Greenland’s 56,000 residents got extensive home rule in 1979 but Denmark still handles foreign and defense policies, with an annual subsidy of $670 million.Its indigenous people are not wealthy, and vehicles, restaurants, stores and basic services are few.Image Source : APGreenland in Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realGreenland in Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realTrump said Sunday he’s interested in Greenland “strategically,” but its purchase is “not No. 1 on the burner.”Although Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called Trump’s idea to purchase Greenland an “absurd discussion,” prompting him to call her “nasty” and cancel an upcoming visit to Copenhagen, she also acknowledged its importance to both nations.“The developments in the Arctic region calls for further cooperation between the U.S. and Greenland, the Faeroe Islands and Denmark,” she said. “Therefore I would like to underline our invitation for a stronger cooperation on Arctic affairs still stands.”Greenland is thought to have the largest deposits outside China of rare earth minerals used to make batteries and cellphones.Image Source : APGreenland in Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realGreenland in Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realSuch minerals were deemed critical to economic and national security by the U.S. Interior Department last year, and as demand rises “deposits outside of China will be sought to serve as a counterbalance to any market control that could be exerted by a single large producer,” said Kenneth Medlock, senior director at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University.Off Greenland’s shores, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates there could be 17.5 billion undiscovered barrels of oil and 148 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, though the remote location and harsh weather have limited exploration. Around the Arctic Circle, there’s potential for 90 billion barrels of oil.Only 14 offshore wells were drilled in the past 40 years, according to S&P Global Analytics. So far, no oil in exploitable quantities has been found.Image Source : APGreenland is Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realGreenland is Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is real“It’s very speculative, but in theory they could have a lot of oil,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research Inc. “It’s perceived as being the new Alaska, where the old Alaska was thought to be worthless and turned out to have huge reserves. And it’s one of the few places on Earth that’s lightly populated, and it’s close to the U.S.”Michael Byers, an Arctic expert at the University of British Columbia, suggests there are better approaches for Washington than the politically awkward suggestion of purchasing Greenland.“There’s no security concern that would be dealt with better if Greenland became a part of the United States. It’s part of the NATO alliance,” he said. “As for resources, Greenland is open to foreign investment. Arctic resources are expensive and that is why there is not more activity taking place. That’s the barrier. It’s not about Greenland restricting access.”Image Source : APGreenland is Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realGreenland is Melting: Pictures from Atlantic show how climate change is realThat’s been the approach taken by China, which has had mixed success. Greenland officials have visited China to look for investors but Beijing’s interest also has provoked political unease.In 2016, Denmark reversed plans to sell Groennedal, a former U.S. naval base that the Danish military had used as its command center for Greenland after a Hong Kong company, General Nice Group, emerged as a bidder, according to defencewatch.dk, a Danish news outlet.Last year, then-U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis successfully pressured Denmark not to let China bankroll three commercial airports on Greenland, over fears they could give Beijing a military foothold near Canada, The Wall Street Journal reported.Beijing’s biggest Greenland-related investment to date is an ownership stake by a Chinese company in Australia-based Greenland Minerals Ltd., which plans to mine rare earths and uranium.“People talk about China, but China can access Arctic resources through foreign investment,” Byers said. “And foreign investment is a lot cheaper than trying to conquer something.”"
56d559c3aaa80e327ce285252f061ebd,"Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly is defending an alleged effort by top White House adviser Jared Kushner to create back-channel communications with Russia, describing it as a “good thing” as the Trump administration sought to quell mounting questions over secret ties to the Kremlin.Speaking on Sunday’s news shows, Kelly said he didn’t know whether the reports by The Associated Press and other news outlets involving Kushner, who is President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, were true. But Kelly said such back-channel communications don’t bother him and would not be harmful to U.S. security interests.“It’s both normal, in my opinion, and acceptable,” Kelly said. “Any way that you can communicate with people, particularly organizations that are maybe not particularly friendly to us, is a good thing.”Congressional Democrats demanded to hear directly from Kushner over allegations of the proposed secret back-channel, saying his security clearance may need to be revoked. But Trump immediately railed against administration leaks in a flurry of tweets Sunday, calling them “fabricated lies.”Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said it was “obviously very concerning” if a key Trump campaign figure was possibly seeking secret communications during the transition period with a country that intelligence experts say intervened in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Schiff said the government needed to “get to the bottom” of the matter and urged a review of Kushner’s security clearance “to find out whether he was truthful.”“If not, then there’s no way he can maintain that kind of a clearance,” Schiff said.The AP and other news organizations reported that Kushner in December proposed a back channel between the Kremlin and the Trump transition team. Kushner spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about facilitating sensitive discussions to explore the incoming administration’s options with Russia as it developed its Syria policy. The intent was to connect Trump’s chief national security adviser at the time, Michael Flynn, with Russian military leaders, a person familiar with the discussions told the AP. The person wasn’t authorized to publicly discuss private policy deliberations and insisted on anonymity.Russia, a pivotal player in Syria, has backed Syrian President Bashar Assad, often at the expense of civilians and at odds with U.S. policy during Syria’s long civil war.The White House did not acknowledge the meeting or Kushner’s attendance until March. At the time, a White House official dismissed it as a brief courtesy meeting.Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, described the latest allegations involving Kushner as “serious” and called for a thorough investigation.“He needs to answer for what was happening at the time,” Booker said. “What’s worrying me are the patterns we’re seeing. So one is this administration not talking about our values, cozying up to authoritarian leaders. And the other pattern we have is just a continuous drumbeat of inappropriate contacts with the Russians.”Lawyers for Kushner said he was willing to talk with federal and congressional investigators about his foreign contacts and his work on the Trump campaign.The disclosure of the back channel has put the White House on the defensive. Just back from visiting the Middle East and Europe, Trump on Sunday dismissed recent reports as “fake news.”“It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies,” Trump tweeted. He added: “Whenever you see the words ‘sources say’ in the fake news media, and they don’t mention names ... it is very possible that those sources don’t exist.”Kushner’s involvement in the proposed back channel was first reported by The Washington Post, which said he suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities for the discussions, apparently to make them more difficult to monitor. The newspaper cited anonymous U.S. officials who were briefed on intelligence reports on intercepted Russian communications.The Post reported that Kislyak was taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate — a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well for as the Trump team.According to the person familiar with the Kushner meeting, the Trump team eventually felt there was no need for a back channel once Rex Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of state on Feb. 1.Flynn served briefly as Trump’s national security adviser before being fired in February. Officials said he misled Vice President Mike Pence about whether he and the ambassador had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia in a phone call.Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general, told Congress this month that the deception left Flynn vulnerable to being blackmailed by the Russians. Flynn remains under federal investigation in Virginia over his foreign business ties. He was interviewed by the FBI in January about his contacts with Kislyak.Kushner was a trusted Trump adviser last year, overseeing the campaign’s digital strategy. He remains an influential confidant within the White House as does his wife, Ivanka Trump.Reuters has reported that Kushner had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with Kislyak last year, including two phone calls between April and November. Kushner’s attorney, Jamie Gorelick, told Reuters that Kushner “has no recollection of the calls as described.”Federal investigators and several congressional committees are looking into any connections between Russia and the Trump campaign, including allegations that there may have been collaboration to help Trump and harm his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.The Senate intelligence committee, which is investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has requested information and documents from Trump’s campaign dating back to July 2015, the AP and other news outlets confirmed.Kelly appeared on “Fox News Sunday,” NBC’s “Meet the Press” and ABC’s “This Week,” Schiff also spoke on ABC, and Booker was on CNN’s “State of the Union.”"

Those put Biden in a stronger position to capture the 270 Electoral College votes needed to take the White House. The winner will lead a country facing a historic set of challenges, including a surging pandemic and deep political polarization.Trump remained in the White House residence Friday morning as his campaign insisted the election wasn't over. Biden was at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, as the vote count continued. FULL COVERAGEThe focus on Pennsylvania, where Biden led Trump by more than 9,000 votes, and Georgia, where Biden led by more than 1,500, came as Americans entered a third full day after the election without knowing who will lead them for the next four years. The prolonged process added to the anxiety of a nation whose racial and cultural divides were inflamed during the heated campaign.With his pathway to reelection appearing to greatly narrow, Trump was testing how far he could go in using the trappings of presidential power to undermine confidence in the vote.ALSO READ | Election not over...

680fdbc1c5e59f2ad24edd601262fcc2,"China reacts to India, says shared all data with WHO to probe Covid originChina said on Thursday that it has shared all data and analyses with the experts of the World Health Organization (WHO) tracing the origin of Covid-19, and it is ready to continue working with global experts to jointly study and analyse the data.The joint study group of WHO and China to trace the origin of Covid-19 released a report two days ago, in which it flagged that more data will be made available to the investigators by Beijing.A day after the report was released, India had demanded a comprehensive and expert-led mechanism to expeditiously investigate the origin of coronavirus. The US, the UK and several other countries have also voiced their concerns over the findings.Reacting to India's demand, China said that they had twice invited WHO experts for the study of the origin of Covid-19 and offered necessary facilitation for the team's work, fully demonstrating its openness, transparency and responsible attitude.China further said that the joint study group tracing the origin of Covid-19 has unanimously agreed that the allegation of a 'lab leak' is extremely unlikely.The experts of the joint mission made field trips to several institutions, including the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, besides visiting the biosafety laboratories, and had in-depth and candid exchanges with the experts there.""Members of the mission unanimously agreed that the allegation of lab leaking is extremely unlikely, and this is an important scientific conclusion made clear in the joint study report released this time,"" said the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy.The spokesperson also said that as for the question of further research, the experts of the WHO mission said that there has always been speculation about lab leak, and work could be done with laboratories around the world if there is further evidence that the hypothesis needs to be reassessed.The experts also said that the virus may have been spread in places other than China early on, and a global perspective is needed to carry out the origin-tracing work.""The report also proposes multiple tasks to be conducted worldwide. We hope relevant countries can cooperate with the WHO expert mission in an open, transparent and responsible manner like China did,"" the spokesperson said.As for the issue on accessing raw data, after China and WHO agreed on the terms of reference in July last year, China carried out data collection, collation and analysis in accordance with the suggestions of the foreign experts.The Chinese authorities gathered relevant institutions and several hundred scientists to collect, collate data and conduct initial analysis, and presented item by item raw data of particular concern to the WHO experts.The international experts have also said on many occasions that they had full and candid discussions with the Chinese side with regard to data issues.As the medical files contain a large amount of information which concern personal privacy, the relevant data are not allowed by the law to be copied or taken abroad, which is a common practice in many countries. The international experts said they completely understand the situation, the spokesperson said.Going forward, China stands ready to continue working with international experts to jointly study and analyse the data.The spokesperson further pointed out that the study of origins is a matter of science.To politicise this issue will only severely hinder global cooperation in the study of origins, jeopardise anti-pandemic cooperation, and cost more lives.It would run counter to the international community's aspiration for solidarity against the virus.""Study of origins is also a global mission that should be conducted in multiple countries and localities.

7a54c17c9022f490113278ca3dce0930,"U.S. Senator Thom TillisA top US senator has unveiled an 18-point plan, including enhancing military ties with India, to hold the Chinese government accountable for its ""lies, deception, and cover-ups"" that ultimately led to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The prominent suggestions are moving manufacturing chain from China and deepening military-strategic ties India, Vietnam and Taiwan.""The Chinese government maliciously covered up and enabled a global pandemic that has caused misery for so many Americans. This is the same regime that locks up its own citizens in labour camps, steals America's technology and jobs, and threatens the sovereignty of our allies,” said Senator Thom Tillis, presenting his detailed, 18-point plan on Thursday.""This is a major wake-up call to the United States and the rest of the free world. My plan of action will hold the Chinese government accountable for lying about COVID-19; sanctioning the Chinese government while protecting America's economy, public health, and national security,"" he said.The plan seeking to create a Pacific Deterrence Initiative and immediately approve the military's request for USD 20 billion in funding. It also calls for deepening military ties with regional allies and expand equipment sales to India, Taiwan and Vietnam.Encourage Japan to rebuild its military and offer Japan and South Korea sales of offensive military equipment, it said.""Move manufacturing back to the US from China and gradually eliminate our supply chain dependency on China. Stop China from stealing our technology and provide incentives to American companies to regain our technological advantage. Strengthen cybersecurity against Chinese hacks and sabotage,"" the plan stated.""Prevent American taxpayer money from being used by the Chinese government to pay off their debt. Implement the US ban on (Chinese technology company) Huawei and coordinate with our allies to implement similar bans,” it added.The plan seeks restitution from the Chinese government and imposition of sanctions for lying about the virus. It further said China should be sanctioned for their atrocious human rights record.Senator Tillis' plan urges the Trump Administration to formally request the International Olympic Committee to withdraw the 2022 Winter Olympics from Beijing.""Stop China's propaganda campaign inside the United States. Treat Chinese government-run media outlets as the propaganda proxies that they are,"" the plan stated.Urging the government to investigate the Chinese government's cover-up of the spread of COVID-19, the plan also seeks to investigate America's reliance on China's supply chains and threats to public safety and national security.""Ensure the independence of the WHO through investigations and reform. Expose and counter China's predatory debt-trap diplomacy targeting developing countries. Increase intelligence sharing on potential pandemics and lead the creation of a watchdog organization to monitor foreign governments' handling of deadly viruses,"" Tillis said in his suggestions.The coronavirus, which first emerged in China's Wuhan city in December last, has killed over 3,00,000 people with 4.3 million confirmed cases across the world. More than a quarter of all confirmed COVID-19 cases are from the US.There has been increasing pressure on the President Trump, in the last several weeks, to take action against China as lawmakers and opinion-makers feel that the COVID-19 spread across the world from Wuhan because of Chinese inaction.Meanwhile, Senator John Barrasso, in a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday, highlighted the need to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) legislation that was put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic.""The virus could have been contained had it not been for the Chinese Government's unscrupulous cover-up. China knew the risk months before the rest of the world; yet Chinese communist leaders destroyed key evidence, they under-reported the number of coronavirus cases, and they misled the world about its deadly, rapid spread,"" he said.Asserting that the virus should have been contained in Wuhan, he said tens and tens of thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of people worldwide have died as a result of China's failure.Barrasso said the US should encourage its companies to create American and western supply chains. ""That way our frontline workers have what they need in the time of crisis,"" he said.""Not again, not ever will we be exclusively sourced for critical drugs from China. We should diversify supply and bring home as much of our supply chain as possible,"" he added.Congressman Troy Balderson introduced bicameral legislation with Congressman Doug Collins and Senator Lindsey Graham that will hold China accountable for deceptive actions taken by its leaders that led to the spread and subsequent global pandemic.The COVID-19 Accountability Act authorises President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on China if it fails to cooperate with a full investigation led by the US or its allies into the events that lead to the COVID-19 outbreak.""The number of Ohioan lives needlessly claimed by this pandemic could have been significantly reduced had China taken appropriate measures to control the virus' spread and disclose its severity,"" said Balderson.""The United States can't look the other way when China so recklessly compromised worldwide health and the global economy.

002bec494a7da02357cbca33a3ac72bc,"Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves 10 Downing Street as he makes his way to the parliament to make a statement, in London, Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022. Russia launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine on Thursday, hitting cities and bases with airstrikes or shelling, as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would aim to cut Russia off from the U.K.’s financial markets as he announced a new set of sanctions in response to President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.The sanctions include freezing the assets of all major Russian banks, including VTB Bank, the nation’s second-biggest bank, Johnson said Thursday. Britain also plans to bar Russian companies and the Russian government from raising money on U.K. markets.Britain will also ban the export of a wide range of high-tech products, including semiconductors, to Russia and to prohibit the nation’s flagship airline, Aeroflot, from landing at U.K. airports.The slate of sanctions comes days after Johnson was criticized for acting too cautiously in response to Russian aggression earlier this week.In an address to the nation Tuesday afternoon, Johnson had promised a new round of sanctions in light of Russia’s “full-scale” invasion of Ukraine.The U.K. says it is coordinating sanctions with the United States and European Union, but both of those entities introduced tougher measures than Britain earlier this week.Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.K., Vadym Prystaiko, earlier called on world leaders to ban trade in Russian oil and gas and block foreign investment in the country.NATO had already reinforced its eastern flank facing Russia and planned a virtual summit of its leaders on Friday after President Vladimir Putin warned that any interference from other countries would lead to ""consequences you have never seen in history.”European Union and NATO member Lithuania declared a state of emergency since the Baltic nation borders Russia’s Kaliningrad region to the southwest and Russia's ally Belarus to the east. NATO countries had 100 jets and 120 ships on high alert as a deterrent.""Make no mistake: We will defend every ally against any attack on every inch of NATO territory,” said NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Stoltenberg both called the invasion a “barbaric"" attack on an independent nation that threatened “the stability in Europe and the whole of the international peace order.” The EU scheduled an emergency summit in Brussels.But no one promised to move in militarily and defend Ukraine at the risk of touching off a bigger European war. Ukraine is not a NATO member, and the U.S. and its Western allies have said for weeks that they would not send troops into the country.The goal instead is to make Moscow pay so high a price by other means that the Kremlin will change course.“Our mission is clear: Diplomatically, politically, economically and eventually militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,” said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Almost all of the world — but not China — condemned the attack and threatened to hit the Russian elites with, in the words of the EU president, “massive and targeted sanctions.” Von der Leyen said she would put to EU leaders late Thursday a proposal that would target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking access to key technologies and markets.She said the sanctions, if approved, “will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernize. And in addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets.”“We want to cut off Russia’s industry from the technologies desperately needed today to build the future,” von der Leyen said.In the days before the attack, Germany suspended approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, and the EU imposed sanctions against hundreds of Russian lawmakers and other officials and institutions from the defense and banking worlds. The EU also sought to limit Moscow's access to capital and financial markets.In a similar bid to fend off an invasion, U.S. President Joe Biden announced sanctions over the past few days against Russian banks and oligarchs and warned of even heavier penalties in the event of an attack. He convened a morning meeting Thursday of his National Security Council to deal with the crisis.Von der Leyen insisted all Western powers were in lockstep on the crisis. Even Hungary, an often recalcitrant member of the EU, promptly condemned the attack, raising hopes that the 27 states would quickly achieve the required unanimity for the sanctions package.Highlighting a widening rift in superpower relations, China stood alone in failing to condemn the attack and instead accused the United States and its allies of worsening the crisis.China went further and approved imports of wheat from Russia, a move that could reduce the impact of Western sanctions. Russia, one of the biggest wheat producers, would be vulnerable if foreign markets were closed off.In a clear defense of Moscow, China “called on parties to respect others' legitimate security concerns.”Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said that “all parties should work for peace instead of escalating the tension or hyping up the possibility of war” — language China has consistently used to criticize the West in the crisis.One thing was clear: Weeks of diplomatic cajoling, global crisscrossing of leaders and foreign ministers, and the threat of sanctions against Putin's inner circle had failed to persuade the Kremlin not to plunge Europe into one of its biggest crises since the end of the Cold War.The turmoil set off by the attack rippled from Europe to Asia. Stock markets plunged, oil prices surged, and European aviation officials warned of the danger to civilian aircraft over Ukraine amid the fighting.Oil prices climbed by more than $5 per barrel. Brent crude briefly jumped above $100 per barrel in London for the first time since 2014 over fears of a disruption of supplies from Russia, the No. 3 producer.The possible repercussions extended well beyond economics and geopolitics.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)President Donald Trump said Tuesday he’s open to some states “reopening” before federal social distancing guidelines expire at the end of month, as he appeared to back off his claim of absolute authority to decide when the time was right to act.Hours after suggesting that the bipartisan concerns of governors about his assertion of power would amount to an insurrection, Trump abruptly reversed course, saying he would leave it to governors to determine the right time and manner to revive activity in their states. Trump said he would be speaking with governors, probably on Thursday, to discuss his plans.“The governors are responsible,” Trump said Tuesday. “They have to take charge.”Still, he insisted, “The governors will be very, very respectful of the presidency.”Democratic and Republican governors had sounded the alarm after Trump asserted on Monday that he and he alone would determine when and how to reopen the economy, despite clear constitutional limitations on federal powers.Trump said Tuesday he would be authorizing governors “of each individual state to implement a reopening — and a very powerful reopening — plan of their state at a time and in a matter as most appropriate.” Trump added that he would support moves by states that haven’t been hit hard by the outbreak to ease restrictions even before federal guidelines on social distancing expire April 30.Trump said the country would open up “in beautiful little pieces,” adding that some states with low rates of infection ”have fewer people and they have lots of room.”It’s unclear if any states are actively considering reopening their economies before May 1.In a departure from recent tradition, Trump ended his daily briefing without turning the mic over to federal health experts, who have cautioned against moving too quickly to restart economic activity.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infections diseases expert, told the AP earlier Tuesday that the country is “not there yet” when it comes to the kind of testing and contact tracing needed to begin reopening the economy. But Trump made clear Tuesday he is intent on proceeding with his plans.Trump outlined a vision in which workers would be tested, perhaps on a weekly basis, and governors would test travelers arriving at their states’ borders. But the U.S. is nowhere near having that kind of infrastructure, with testing still largely reserved for those with serious symptoms and results taking days to learn.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been working with other federal officials to develop detailed plans for how reopening should occur, including determining what measures will need to be tracked and what conditions met before such steps occur. The plans include separate steps for schools, businesses and other entities, the CDC’s Dr. Anne Schuchat said. The proposals are currently under review, she added.In expressing an openness to states setting their own timelines, Trump was largely acknowledging the authority governors have already exercised.While Trump has issued national recommendations advising people to stay home, it has been governors and local leaders who have instituted mandatory restrictions, including shuttering schools and closing nonessential businesses. Some of those orders carry fines or other penalties.It was the latest twist in Trump’s dispute with governors over who has primary responsibility for preserving public health in their jurisdictions. After weeks of saying he would leave major decisions about imposing restrictions in the hands of states, Trump claimed his power to ease them was absolute.“When somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total,” Trump said Monday at the White House. “The governors know that.” He declined to offer specifics about the source of his asserted power, claiming he would provide a legal briefing at a later date.But governors in both parties made clear they saw things differently, and said they would decide when it’s safe to begin a return to normal operations, just as they were the ones who closed things down.“The president’s position is just absurd,” New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday on “CBS This Morning.” “It’s not the law. It’s not the Constitution. We don’t have a king. We have a president.”Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, also a Republican, said he, too, expected the call to remain with the states.“I welcome national guidance and assistance,” he said. “But we will do what is needed in the best interest of Arkansans and I think that’s what the people expect.”Anxious to put the crisis behind him, Trump launched a new advisory council that will hash out plans to reopen the American economy, which has dramatically contracted as businesses have shuttered, leaving millions of people out of work.He also directed his administration to freeze funding to the World Health Organization, claiming the international body didn’t deliver adequate early reports on the virus and cost the U.S. valuable response time.“The WHO failed in this basic duty and must be held accountable,” Trump said. He said the U.S. would review the organizaiton’s warning about the virus threat and China.Earlier Tuesday, Trump initially indicated he was relishing the fight with state officials — particularly Democrats in hard-hit states — who have voiced fears that the president’s ambitious timetable could lead to a resurgence of a virus that is still killing more than 1,000 Americans a day.“A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain,” Trump tweeted, adding, “Too easy!”Trump began to soften his approach later in the day as he met with people who have recovered from COVID-19, including former pro football player Mark Campbell and Karen Whitsett, a member of the Michigan House.“I’m going to be making a decision pretty quickly,” he said, “and it’s being done in conjunction with governors.”Still, Trump warned that he would be monitoring the performance of governors, and signaled he might blame them if he believes their actions slow the pace of what he hopes will be a robust economic recovery.“If they don’t do a good job we’re going to come down on them hard,” Trump said."
d650161f6970be349b6e6d67efd46532,"A helicopter drops water on Windy Fire burning in Trail of 100 Giants grove of Sequoia National Forest, California.  In the wake of California wildfires, upwards of 10,000 trees weakened by fires, drought, disease or age must be removed, work that will keep a nearby highway closed to visitors who seek the world’s two largest sequoia trees.The hazard trees could potentially fall onto people and cars on the section of State Route 180 known as Generals Highway, or they could create barriers for emergency and fire response, the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks said Friday.The highway is closed due to the KNP Complex blaze, which was 60% contained after burning 138 square miles (357 square kilometers) of forest, and will remain blocked off to visitors after the fire is out while saw crews cut down trees and trim branches. Cooler weather has helped slow the flames and the area was expected to see rain starting Sunday.The highway connects Giant Forest, home to the General Sherman Tree, which is considered the world’s largest by volume, and Grant Grove, home to the General Grant Tree, the second-largest tree in the world. The trees along the highway include sequoias, pine and conifer trees, said fire spokeswoman Kimberly Caschalk.The KNP Complex has been burning since Sept. 9, when lightning ignited two fires that later merged.Forest officials said earlier this month the fires may have killed hundreds of giant sequoias, but the full extent of the damage has not been determined.The fire’s impact on giant sequoia groves was mixed. Most saw low- to medium-intensity fire behavior that the sequoias have evolved to survive, and the most notable trees survived.Firefighters took extraordinary measures to protect the sequoias by wrapping fire-resistant material around the bases of some giants, raking and clearing vegetation around them, installing sprinklers and dousing some with water or fire retardant gel.On Friday, forest staff unwrapped the base of the General Sherman tree after danger from the fire had passed.“We’re confident that tree is relatively safe,” Caschalk said.Drought in the West tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years- meaning the rain and snow that does fall is likely to evaporate or absorb into the soil- and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.Recent storms have helped contain some of the nation’s largest wildfires this year, including one that threatened the popular Lake Tahoe resort region this summer and is now 100% contained after snow blanketed the western side of the blaze and rain dropped on the eastern side. But this week’s storms won’t end drought that’s plaguing California and the western United States.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_1751836831 = { ""file"": ""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_484fdveo_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_484fdveo_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""California Wildfire: Not scenes from a movie, but it's Real and Deadly"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""215"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_1751836831 = ''; jwsetup_1751836831(); function jwsetup_1751836831() { jwvidplayer_1751836831 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_1751836831"").setup(jwconfig_1751836831); jwvidplayer_1751836831.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_1751836831, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_484fdveo\"", ns_st_pr=\""California Wildfire: Not scenes from a movie, but it's Real and Deadly\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""California Wildfire: Not scenes from a movie, but it's Real and Deadly\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""California Wildfire: Not scenes from a movie, but it's Real and Deadly\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2020-09-10\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2020-09-10\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_484fdveo_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_1751836831.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_1751836831.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_1751836831.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_1751836831.stop(); jwvidplayer_1751836831.remove(); jwvidplayer_1751836831 = ''; jwsetup_1751836831(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_1751836831.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_1751836831.stop(); jwvidplayer_1751836831.remove(); jwvidplayer_1751836831 = ''; jwsetup_1751836831(); return; }); jwvidplayer_1751836831.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1751836831.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1751836831.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1751836831.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1751836831.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_1751836831.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

c6b910a41ec165ab0f3621bce0f2aa9d,"North Korea threatens to cancel Kim Jong-Trump summit; US 'going ahead' with preparations Taking strong exception to the military exercises between Seoul and Washington, North Korea cancelled a high-level meeting with South Korea and threatened to scrap the historic meeting between its leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump, even as the US maintained it was going ahead with the summit preparations. Uncertainty looms larger over the June 12 summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore after North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released an statement in this regards hours before the two Koreas were to meet at a border village today. The two countries expected to discuss ways to implement their leaders' recent agreements to reduce military tensions along their heavily fortified border and improve their overall ties. Related Stories US willing to help North Korea if it agrees to complete denuclearisation: Mike PompeoAhead of Trump-Kim summit, North Korea vows to destroy nuclear tunnels; US, South Korea welcome decision Ahead of Trump-Kim summit, North Korean delegation visits China North Korea, South Korea to hold high-level inter-Korea talks on May 16The statement that comes after a brief hiatus in the war of words between Trump and Kim is likely to mar efforts towards building a denuclearised Korean Peninsula. The White House said it would independently look at what Pyongyang has said. The State Department said it was going ahead with preparations for the summit as planned earlier. In a statement attributable to KCNA, Pyongyang cited the ongoing military exercise between the US and South Korea as a reason behind the move. ""The joint exercise is a reflection of the invariable stand of the US and south Korea to persist in the 'maximum pressure and sanctions' against the DPRK,"" it said. DPRK stands for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is more commonly known as North Korea. In a related development, North Korea also cancelled its May 16 talks with the South.   ""We cannot but take a step of suspending the North-South high-level talks scheduled on May 16 under the prevailing seriously awful situation that a mad-cap North-targeted war and confrontation racket are being kicked up in South Korea,"" KCNA said. North Korea held the South Korean authorities ""wholly accountable"" for the scuttled North-South talks and unease in the North-South relations. ""The US will have to think twice about the fate of the DPRK-US summit now on high agenda before a provocative military racket against the DPRK in league with the south Korean authorities,"" the statement said.   White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the US is aware of the media reports in this regard. ""The United States will look at what North Korea has said independently, and continue to coordinate closely with our allies,"" Sanders said. The State Department said it is continuing with the preparations for the summit and there has been no word from North Korea on the ongoing exercises. State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said Kim had previously indicated he understood the need and purpose of the US continuing its long-planned joint exercises with South Korea. ""We have not heard anything from that government or the Government of South Korea to indicate that we would not continue conducting these exercises or that we would not continue planning for our meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un next month,"" she told reporters at her daily news conference. According to Col Rob Manning, the Pentagon Spokesperson, South Korea Republic and US military forces are currently engaged in the recurring, annual ROK-US drills, to include exercises Foal Eagle 2018 and Max Thunder 2018. ""These defencive exercises are part of the ROK-US Alliance's routine, annual training program to maintain a foundation of military readiness,"" he said. ""The purpose of the training is to enhance the ROK-US Alliance's ability to defend the ROK and enhance interoperability and readiness. While we will not discuss specifics, the defencive nature of these combined exercises has been clear for many decades and has not changed,"" Manning said. The State Department refuted the allegations that these exercises are provocative in nature. ""They're certainly not provocative. These are things that we do all around the world with many of our partners and allies. These are things that have occurred for decades and decades,"" Nauert said.   At the same time, she ruled out the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reaching out to the North Koreans in this regard. ""I don't think he's picking up the phone and begging anybody to do anything at this point. We are operating under the idea and the notion that the president's meeting is going forward with Chairman Kim next month,"" Nauert said in response to a question."

Ten alleged members of the Cartel of the Northeast were killed in the response.Videos of the shootout posted on social media showed burned out vehicles and the facade of Villa Union’s municipal office riddled with bullets. Rapid gunfire could be heard in videos along with frantic people telling loved ones to stay indoors. A damaged black pickup truck with the C.D.N. of the Cartel del Noreste, or Cartel of the Northeast, written in white on its door is seen on the street.Security forces will remain in the town for several days to restore a sense of calm, the governor said.“These groups won’t be allowed to enter state territory,” the government of Coahuila said in a statement.Mexico’s murder rate has increased to historically high levels, inching up by 2% in the first 10 months of the presidency of Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

f36172fa0f7d519273ac632e106d2ed6,"Raging forest fires in central Portugal killed at least 57 people, many of them trapped in their cars as flames swept over a road, in what the prime minister on Sunday called “the biggest tragedy of human life that we have known in years.”Nearly 60 other people were injured, including four firefighters and a seriously injured minor, Interior Ministry official Jorge Gomes told state broadcaster RTP.A lightning strike is believed to have sparked the blaze in the Pedrogao Grande area after investigators found a tree that was hit during a “dry thunderstorm,” the head of the national judicial police told Portuguese media. Dry thunderstorms are frequent when falling water evaporates before reaching the ground because of high temperatures. Portugal, like most southern European countries, is prone to forest fires in the dry summer months.“This is a region that has had fires because of its forests, but we cannot remember a tragedy of these proportions,” said Valdemar Alves, mayor of Pedrogao Grande. “I am completely stunned by the number of deaths.”Authorities had previously said that 40 C (104 F) heat in recent days might have played a part in the inferno about 150 kilometers (95 miles) northeast of Lisbon. About 700 firefighters have been trying to put out the fires since Saturday, Gomes said.A huge wall of thick smoke and bright red flames towered over the top of trees near houses in the wooded region. Local resident Isabel Brandao told The Associated Press that she had feared for her life.“Yesterday we saw the fire but thought it was very far. I never thought it would come to this side,” she said. “At 3:30 a.m., my mother-in-law woke me up quickly and we never went to sleep again. We were afraid the fire would reach us.”RTP showed terrifying images of several people on a road trying to escape the intense smoke that had reduced visibility to a question of a few meters (yards). A young man shared a bottle of water with a distraught woman as she stumbled down the road.Gomes said that at least 16 people were killed when their vehicles were engulfed by flames on a road between the towns of Figueiro dos Vinhos and Castanheira de Pera, and three others died from smoke inhalation in Figueiro dos Vinhos. No information was immediately given on how the others were killed.Prime Minister Antonio Costa said that firefighting crews were having difficulties in approaching the area because the fire was “very intense.” He added that Portuguese authorities were working on identifying the victims and that Spanish rescuers would assist in efforts to control the blazes.Portugal’s civil protection agency, which coordinates the firefighting efforts, issued a warning of the increased risk for forest fires in Friday. Citing the high temperatures, it said that all outdoor fires were prohibited.The European Union has activated its civil protection efforts to help Portugal extinguish the fires. EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides expressed his condolences for the victims in a statement, saying the “EU is fully ready to help.”Stylianides says that in response to a request for help by Portugal, Spain and France are both sending aircraft to help fight the flames. France is sending three planes, while Spain has sent several firefighting aircraft.Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy tweeted that he is “overwhelmed by the tragedy at Pedrogao Grande. The Portuguese people can count on our solidarity, support and care.”(With AP inputs)"
c72d1dbb5c5d7790ff9600913ec786f1,"The US feels that the civilian government in Pakistan is “weak” and the Army’s role in ending the recent protests by hardline religious parties in the country has “emboldened” the extremists, a senior Trump administration official has said. Pakistan last month witnessed countrywide protests by hardline religious groups after a reference to the Prophet Muhammad was left out of a revised version of the electoral oath. The protesters called off the demonstrations after Law Minister Zahid Hamid resigned, meeting one of their key demands. A top Pakistani court had criticised the Army’s role to mediate the agreement to end the protests that claimed the lives of six people and injured over 100 others.  “We have seen unhelpful relationships between the military and some of the hardline Islamist parties. We are observing...what happened and what role was played by the military. There is concern that the way these protests ended in a way has emboldened extremism and extremists in Pakistan,” the official told PTI. Observing that the “civil-military tension” in the country is “not helpful”, the official speaking on condition of anonymity said: “The government, right now, is pretty weak.  This was shown by the recent protest.” The official rued that the handling of protests had made it easier in Pakistan for people to levy blasphemy charges which are very unhelpful. There are dozens of Pakistanis on death row for alleged blasphemy in public. “They feel they can take the law into their own hands and continue to levy blasphemy charges, which is unhelpful,” said the official. The freedom of speech, religion, and human rights inside Pakistan is getting worse, the official added.  The White House official further warned that there would be “repercussions” for any military coup in Pakistan, which has a history of such dictatorship at frequent intervals.  “I think the repercussions of military coup would be very great,” the official said. Not only the US-Pakistan relationship would be disrupted, all kinds of sanctions would come into play in case of a military coup.   “It would be very unhelpful,” the official said, but quickly added “at this point of time I’m not convinced that the military is seeking to overturn the government.” But, the military certainly seeks to retain the power that they have within the Pakistani system.  “It would just be extremely unhelpful to see the military try and form the government again,” the official said, hoping the upcoming general elections in Pakistan would be held on schedule next year. The relations between Pakistan’s civilian government and the powerful Army have long been fraught, with the military ruling the country for nearly half of its 70-year history.  “We’re hopeful that there will be election in Pakistan as scheduled to be. And we recognise there may be some political uncertainties leading up to that election. But I think it’s very important that that election is held and that Pakistan demonstrates to the world and to its own people that it continues to be a functioning democracy,” the official said."

However we might be kidding ourselves if we handled it as a complete shock,” Obama mentioned in a prolonged assertion.For 2 months now, a political occasion and its accompanying media ecosystem has too usually been unwilling to inform their followers the reality — that this was not a very shut election and that President-elect Biden can be inaugurated on January 20, he mentioned.“Their fantasy narrative has spiralled additional and farther from actuality, and it builds upon years of sown resentments. Now we’re seeing the results, whipped up right into a violent crescendo,” Obama mentioned. Within the November three presidential election, Biden, a Democrat gained 306 Electoral Faculty votes whereas Trump, a Republican, mustered solely 232 votes.Obama mentioned, “Proper now, Republican leaders have a selection made clear within the desecrated chambers of democracy. They’ll proceed down this highway and hold stoking the raging fires. Or they will select actuality and take the primary steps towards extinguishing the flames. They’ll select America.”The previous president mentioned he was heartened to see many members of Trump’s occasion communicate up forcefully in the present day.“Their voices add to the examples of Republican state and native election officers in states like Georgia who’ve refused to be intimidated and have discharged their duties honourably. We’d like extra leaders like these — proper now and within the days, weeks, and months forward as President-elect Biden works to revive a standard objective to our politics. It is as much as all of us as Individuals, no matter occasion, to assist him in that objective,” he mentioned.In a separate assertion, former US President George W Bush mentioned he and the previous First Woman watched the scenes of “mayhem unfolding on the seat of our nation’s authorities in disbelief and dismay”.“It’s a sickening and heartbreaking sight. That is how election outcomes are disputed in a banana republic – not our democratic republic. I’m appalled by the reckless behaviour of some political leaders for the reason that election and by the shortage of respect proven in the present day for our establishments, our traditions, and our legislation enforcement,” he mentioned.The violent assault on the Capitol – and disruption of a Constitutionally-mandated assembly of Congress – was undertaken by folks whose passions have been infected by falsehoods and false hopes. Rebel might do grave harm to our nation and repute, Bush mentioned.Within the US, he mentioned, it’s the elementary accountability of each patriotic citizen to assist the rule of legislation.“To those that are upset within the outcomes of the election: Our nation is extra essential than the politics of the second. Let the officers elected by the folks fulfil their duties and signify our voices in peace and security,” Bush mentioned.Based on former US President Invoice Clinton, the “unprecedented assault on our Capitol, our Structure, and our nation” was fuelled by greater than 4 years of “poison politics” spreading deliberate misinformation, sowing mistrust within the system and “pitting Individuals in opposition to each other”.“We should reject in the present day’s violence, flip the web page and transfer ahead collectively — honouring our Structure, remaining dedicated to a authorities of the folks, by the folks, and for the folks,” he mentioned.Former Secretary of State and First Woman, Hillary Clinton, mentioned “home terrorists” attacked a basis of American democracy: the peaceable switch of energy following free elections.“We should reestablish the rule of legislation and maintain them accountable. Democracy is fragile. Our leaders should dwell as much as their accountability to guard it,” she mentioned.Former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush alleged that Trump provoked the disgusting occasions on the Capitol.“He has gone from creating chaos to inciting rebellion.

ecc3de3d1b35051167aae1b8ef5e08b0,"In more than two dozen US cities, anti-Sharia marches are being organised today.ACT for America , the group organizing the rallies, claims Shariah “is incompatible with Western democracy and the freedoms it affords.”However, scholars and others say the protesters are stoking unfounded fears and promoting a distorted and prejudiced view of the religion.According to Liyakat Takim, a professor of Islamic studies at McMaster University in the Canadian city of Hamilton, most Muslims don’t want to replace U.S. law with Islamic law, known as Shariah, and only “radical extremist groups” would call for that. Shariah, Takim said, refers to guidelines or principles — how Muslims should live. “Fiqh” refers to jurisprudence, or specific laws. The values embedded in Shariah do not change and are shared among Muslims, he said, while fiqh is open to interpretation and change, and in fact differs among Islamic sects and communities.“In the public domain, Muslims are not required or expected to impose their laws on the country in which they live as the minority,” Takim said, adding there has never been an understanding “that the same laws would be applicable at all times in all places.”“The Quran allows slavery, so does the Old Testament. That doesn’t mean we allow it today, too,” he said. “Laws are amenable to change.”The marches come amid a rise in reports of anti-Muslim incidents in the U.S., including arson attacks and vandalism at mosques, harassment of women wearing Muslim head coverings and bullying of Muslim schoolchildren.But while there is little likelihood that Shariah would ever supplant U.S. law, some states have already moved to insulate themselves against the possibility.Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Louisiana, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee have enacted laws prohibiting the use of foreign law in state courts, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.In Idaho a Republican lawmaker earlier this year introduced a measure aimed at preventing Shariah from being applied, though an Idaho judge has never based a ruling on Islamic law.Two far-right groups, the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters, are to provide security at some of the anti-Shariah demonstrations, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. ACT for America has chapters around the country and says it is focused on fighting terrorism and promoting national security. It says it condemns bias against religious groups and is “proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with peaceful Western Muslims as well as peaceful Muslims worldwide.”On Saturday counter-demonstrations were planned by opponents who called the events anti-Muslim.Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who says her district has the largest population of Muslims in the U.S., said the marchers “will be total failures on Saturday because we will be united against them.”Freedom of speech has already become a contentious issue surrounding the marches, apparently the first simultaneous anti-Shariah rallies held across the U.S.A march had been planned for Portland, but an organizer moved it to Seattle after Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler called on the federal government to deny a permit. Wheeler said the rally would exacerbate tensions after two men were stabbed to death in May on a commuter train while protecting two teenage girls from a man casting anti-Muslim slurs.The organizer said “inflammatory comments” by Wheeler put participants at risk of violence. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon scolded Wheeler, saying trying to deny a permit without imminent threat of violence amounted to unconstitutional government censorship. (With AP inputs)Seattle was one of the cities where a counter-march was planned. Aneelah Afzali, who heads a Seattle-area group that works against discrimination and hate crimes, said she will also be putting up an “ask a Muslim booth” so people can ask questions directly about Islam, and dispel any misconceptions.“We want to counter (the anti-Shariah march) and keep it as positive as possible, and educate people about what Islam teaches,” Afzali said in a phone interview."

The environmentalist Greens also are eyeing at least a share of power.About 60.4 million people in the nation of 83 million are eligible to elect the new parliament, which decides who will be the next head of government. Recent polls point to a neck-and-neck race between Merkel’s centre-right Union bloc and the Social Democrats, with the latter marginally ahead.The polls show the Greens, making their first bid for the chancellorship, in third place after a campaign in which all three have held the lead. The Social Democrats’ candidate, current finance minister and Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has seen his personal ratings climb amid error-strewn campaigns by his rivals, the Union’s Armin Laschet and the Greens’ Annalena Baerbock.Merkel, who remains personally popular after steering Germany through a string of crises, announced in 2018 that she wouldn’t go for a fifth term. That set up the first election since West Germany’s initial vote in 1949 in which there is no incumbent chancellor seeking re-election.Voters appear underwhelmed by the choices. Whoever finishes first is expected to get a historically low share of the vote, with polls showing no party expected to get 30% support. The lowest score so far for a winning party is the Union’s 31% in 1949, which also is the bloc’s worst showing to date.Such an outcome would likely trigger lengthy haggling on a new governing coalition, with whichever party finishes first best-placed — but not guaranteed — to have its candidate succeed Merkel.A first-place finish for the Social Democrats, who provided three of Germany’s eight post-World War II chancellors but have been Merkel’s junior governing partners for 12 of the past 16 years, would be remarkable after a long poll slump for the party. When the Union and the Greens chose their candidates this spring, the election was widely expected to be a race between the two.The Union was prepared for a Laschet-Baerbock battle and “Laschet wanted practically to act as the incumbent, with all his leadership expertise” from his current job as governor of Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, political science professor Andrea Roemmele of the Hertie School in Berlin said this week.“But now the duel isn’t Laschet against Baerbock, it’s Laschet against Scholz, and in this combination Mr. Laschet has been forced into the role of challenger,” she said. “Scholz is deploying all the power of his vice chancellorship, of the finance minister, and is enjoying campaigning this way; he has simply managed to build up trust.”Scholz also has had the smoothest campaign, although opponents sought to capitalize on a recent police search at his ministry. Baerbock suffered from early gaffes, notably having to correct details in a resume and facing allegations of plagiarism in a new book.Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, was nominated after a divisive internal battle with a rival, then suffered from perceptions that he poorly handled deadly floods that hit his state in July. A scene in which he was seen laughing in the background as Germany’s president delivered solemn remarks about the disaster did not help his campaign image.Those woes have often distracted from policy issues.The leading parties have significant differences in their proposals for tackling climate change. Laschet’s Union is pinning its hopes on technological solutions and a market-driven approach, while the Greens want to ramp up carbon prices and end the use of coal earlier than planned. Scholz has emphasized the need to protect jobs as Europe’s biggest economy transitions to greener energy.Laschet insists there should be no tax increases as Germany pulls out of the coronavirus pandemic, which the country weathered well economically thanks to large rescue packages that have incurred new debt. Scholz and Baerbock favor tax hikes for the richest Germans, and also back an increase in the country’s minimum wage.Foreign policy hasn’t played much of a role in the campaign, though the Greens favor a tougher stance toward China and Russia.As their poll ratings have sagged, Laschet and other Union leaders have issued constant warnings that Scholz and the Greens would form a coalition with the opposition Left Party, which opposes NATO and German military deployments abroad. Whether such a partnership is realistic is questionable, given foreign policy and other differences.Scholz’s first choice would likely be an alliance with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats — and a coalition with those two parties is also Laschet’s likeliest route to power. The Greens favor an alliance with the Social Democrats, and the Free Democrats prefer one with the Union.The election’s result may also allow for a repeat of the outgoing “grand coalition” of the traditional big parties, under either Scholz or Laschet, though there’s unlikely to be much appetite for that on either side. But no party wants to bring the far-right Alternative for Germany into government."

The report published on Wednesday by the Palm Beach Daily News said that ""a permit was pulled on Tuesday for demolition of the town's sole helipad"" at the resort to which Trump moved to on the morning of January 20 ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration as the 46th President of the US.The helipad, a concrete slab measuring 50 feet-long and 8 inches deep, was built in February 2017 on the west lawn of the Mar-a-Lago.According to the report, Town Manager Kirk Blouin said that representatives for the club had inquired about permits to remove the helipad ""in the past few weeks"".""It seems to have been more controversial in media reports than it is in actual practice. They never made a request to keep it,"" the Palm Beach Daily News report quoted Blouin as further saying.The report however, did not mention any date for the beginning of the demolition nor did it say how long would the process take.Palm Beach town does not allow helicopters or helipads, but made an exception for Mar-a-Lago on the conditions that it be used only for business related to the executive office and that it must be removed when Trump left the White House.This latest development comes after a media report revealed late last month that Palm Beach authorities were currently performing a legal review Trump's residency at Mar-a-Lago.It was not immediately clear when the review would be completed.Trump had purchased the resort, also a national historic landmark, in 1985.While in office, Trump hosted meetings for international leaders, including former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping, at the club originally built between 1924 to 1927.In September 2019, Mar-a-Lago became the primary residence for Donald and Melania Trump."

0f5ce19682fd80099a179881b26eb98c,"British Prime Minister Theresa May struck a deal in principle with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party on Saturday to prop up the Conservative government, stripped of its majority in a disastrous election. The result has demolished May’s political authority, and she has also lost her two top aides, sacrificed in a bid to save their leader from being toppled by a furious Conservative Party.The moves buy May a temporary reprieve. But the ballot-box humiliation has seriously — and possibly mortally — wounded her leadership just as Britain is about to begin complex exit talks with the European Union.May’s office said Saturday that the Democratic Unionist Party, which has 10 seats in Parliament, had agreed to a “confidence and supply” arrangement with the government. That means the DUP will back the government on key votes, but it’s not a coalition government or a broader pact.Downing St. said the Cabinet will discuss the agreement on Monday.The announcement came after May lost Downing St. chiefs of staff Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, who resigned Saturday. They formed part of May’s small inner circle and were blamed by many Conservatives for the party’s lackluster campaign and unpopular election platform, which alienated older voters with its plan to take away a winter fuel allowance and make them pay more for long-term care.In a resignation statement on the Conservative Home website, Timothy conceded that the campaign had failed to communicate “Theresa’s positive plan for the future,” and missed signs of surging support for the opposition Labour Party.Some senior Tories had made the removal of Hill and Timothy a condition for continuing to support May, who has vowed to remain prime minister. May’s party won 318 seats, 12 fewer than it had before May called a snap election, and eight short of the 326 needed for an outright majority. The main opposition Labour Party surpassed expectations by winning 262.May announced later that Gavin Barwell — a former housing minister who lost his seat in Thursday’s election — would be her new chief of staff.May said Barwell would help her “reflect on the election and why it did not deliver the result I hoped for.”Conservative legislator Nigel Evans said the departure of the two aides was “a start,” but there needed to be changes to the way the government functioned in the wake of the campaign.He said the Conservative election manifesto — which Hill and Timothy were key in drafting — was “a full assault on the core Tory voters, who are senior citizens.”“It was a disaster,” he said. “Our manifesto was full of fear and the Labour Party’s manifesto was full of promises.”Martin Selmayr, senior aide to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, responded to the resignations by tweeting the word “bauernopfer” — German for the sacrifice of a pawn in chess.May called the early election when her party was comfortably ahead in the polls, in the hope of increasing her majority and strengthening Britain’s hand in exit talks with the EU.Instead, the result has sown confusion and division in British ranks, just days before negotiations are due to start on June 19.May wanted to win explicit backing for her stance on Brexit, which involves leaving the EU’s single market and imposing restrictions on immigration while trying to negotiate free trade deal with the bloc. Some say her failure means the government must now take a more flexible approach to the divorce.The Times of London said in an editorial that “the election appears to have been, among other things, a rejection of the vague but harshly worded prospectus for Brexit for which Mrs. May sought a mandate.”It added that “the logic leading to Mrs. May’s departure from Downing St. is remorseless.”The Downing St. resignations came as May worked to fill jobs in her minority government and replace ministers who lost their seats on Thursday. Her weakened position in the party rules out big changes, and May’s office has said that the most senior Cabinet members — including Treasury chief Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Amber Rudd — will keep their jobs, but she is expected to shuffle the lower ranks of ministers.The arrangement with the DUP will make governing easier, but it makes some Conservatives uneasy. The DUP is a socially conservative pro-British Protestant group that opposes abortion and same-sex marriage and once appointed an environment minister who believes human-driven climate change is a myth.The DUP was founded in the 1970s by the late firebrand preacher Ian Paisley, and in the 1980s was a key player in the “Save Ulster from Sodomy” campaign, which unsuccessfully fought against the legalization of gay sex.Ruth Davidson, the Conservative leader in Scotland, said she had asked May for assurances that there would be no attack on gay rights after a deal with the DUP.Northern Ireland is the only part of the U.K. in which same-sex marriage is illegal.“It’s an issue very close to my heart and one that I wanted categoric assurances from the prime minister on, and I received (them),” said Davidson, who is engaged to be married to her female partner.DUP Leader Arlene Foster recently denied the party was homophobic.“I could not care less what people get up to in terms of their sexuality. That’s not a matter for me,” she said. “When it becomes a matter for me is when people try to redefine marriage.”A deal between the government and the DUP could also unsettle the precarious balance between Northern Ireland’s British loyalist and Irish nationalist parties.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, riding a wave of acclaim for his party’s unexpectedly strong showing, called on May to resign.Newspaper headlines saw her as just clinging on. “May fights to remain PM,” said the front page of the Daily Telegraph, while the Times of London said: “May stares into the abyss.”But she seems secure for the immediate future, because senior Conservatives don’t want to plunge the party into a damaging leadership contest.“I don’t think throwing us into a leadership battle at this moment in time, when we are about to launch into these difficult negotiations, would be in the best interests of the country,” Evans said."

A review of federal purchasing contracts by The Associated Press shows federal agencies waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)After the first alarms sounded in early January that an outbreak of a novel coronavirus in China might ignite a global pandemic, the Trump administration squandered nearly two months that could have been used to bolster the federal stockpile of critically needed medical supplies and equipment.A review of federal purchasing contracts by The Associated Press shows federal agencies largely waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers.By that time, hospitals in several states were treating thousands of infected patients without adequate equipment and were pleading for shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile. That federal cache of supplies was created more than 20 years ago to help bridge gaps in the medical and pharmaceutical supply chains during a national emergency.Now, three months into the crisis, that stockpile is nearly drained just as the numbers of patients needing critical care is surging. Some state and local officials report receiving broken ventilators and decade-old dry-rotted masks.“We basically wasted two months,” Kathleen Sebelius, health and human services secretary during the Obama administration, told AP.As early as mid-January, U.S. officials could see that hospitals in China’s Hubei province were overwhelmed with infected patients, with many left dependent on ventilator machines to breathe. Italy soon followed, with hospitals scrambling for doctors, beds and equipment.HHS did not respond to questions about why federal officials waited to order medical supplies until stocks were running critically low. But President Donald Trump has asserted that the federal government should take a back seat to states when it comes to dealing with the pandemic.When an AP reporter attempted to ask Trump about the issue on Sunday, the president cut off the question.“FEMA, the military, what they’ve done is a miracle,” Trump said with a flash of anger. “What they’ve done is a miracle in getting all of this stuff. What they have done for states is incredible.”Trump then ended the briefing and walked off the podium.Trump and his appointees have urged state and local governments, and hospitals, to buy their own masks and breathing machines, saying requests to the dwindling national stockpile should be a last resort.“The notion of the federal stockpile was it’s supposed to be our stockpile,” Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser, said at a White House briefing Thursday. “It’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use.”Experts in emergency preparedness and response have expressed dismay at such statements, saying the federal government must take the lead in ensuring medical supplies are available and distributed where they are needed most.“States do not have the purchasing power of the federal government. They do not have the ability to run a deficit like the federal government. They do not have the logistical power of the federal government,” said Sebelius, who served as governor of Kansas before running the nation’s health care system.Because of the fractured federal response to COVID-19, state governors say they’re now bidding against federal agencies and each other for scarce supplies, driving up prices.“You now literally will have a company call you up and say, ‘Well, California just outbid you,’” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, D-N.Y., said Tuesday. “It’s like being on eBay with 50 other states, bidding on a ventilator.”For nearly a month, Trump rebuffed calls from Cuomo and others to use his authority under the Defense Production Act to order companies to increase production of ventilators and personal protective equipment. He suggested the private sector was acting sufficiently on its own.More than three months after China revealed the first COVID-19 cases, Trump finally relented last week, saying he will order companies to ramp up production of critical supplies. By then, confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the United States had surged to the highest in the world. Now, the number of people infected in the U.S. has climbed to more than 312,000 and deaths have topped 8,500.Trump spent January and February playing down the threat from the new virus. He derided warnings of pandemic reaching the U.S. as a hoax perpetrated by Democrats and the media. As the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global public health emergency on Jan. 30, Trump assured the American people that the virus was “very well under control” and he predicted “a very good ending.”His administration was so confident that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Feb. 7 that the government had airlifted nearly 18 tons of donated respirator masks, surgical masks, gowns and other medical supplies to China.On Feb. 24, the White House sent Congress an initial $2.5 billion funding request to address the coronavirus outbreak. The next day, federal health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that the virus was spreading quickly in the U.S. and predicted that disruptions to daily life could be “severe,” including school and business closures.Unfazed, HHS Secretary Alex Azar told lawmakers on Feb. 27 that “the immediate risk to the American public remains low.”During those crucial early weeks when the U.S. could have been tracking the spread of the disease and containing it, hardly anyone was being tested after a series of federal blunders led to a shortage of tests and testing capacity, as AP reported last month.Without data showing how widespread the disease was, federal and state governments failed to prepare.By the middle of March, hospitals in New York, Seattle and New Orleans were reporting a surge in sick patients. Doctors and nurses took to social media to express their alarm at dwindling supplies of such basic equipment as masks and gowns.Trump accused some Democratic governors of exaggerating the need and derided those that criticized the federal response as complainers and snakes.“I want them to be appreciative,” Trump said on March 27.At the start of the crisis, an HHS spokeswoman said the Strategic National Stockpile had about 13 million N95 respirator masks, which filter out about 95% of all liquid or airborne particles and are critical to prevent health care workers from becoming infected. That’s just a small fraction of what hospitals need to protect their workers, who normally would wear a new mask for each patient, but who now are often issued only one to last for days.Trump during a White House briefing on March 26 claimed that he had inherited an “empty shelf” from the Obama administration, but added that “we’re really filling it up, and we fill it up rapidly.”Federal purchasing records, however, show the Trump administration delayed making big orders for additional supplies until the virus had taken root and was spreading.HHS first announced its intent to purchase 500 million N95 masks on March 4, with plans to distribute them over the next 18 months. The following day, Congress passed an $8.3 billion coronavirus spending bill, more than three times what the White House had originally asked for.Eight days later, on March 13, Trump declared the outbreak a national emergency. That was almost six weeks after the WHO’s action. By then, thousands of U.S. schools had closed, the National Basketball Association had put its season on temporary hiatus and there were 1,700 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country.The government had already sent tens of thousands of masks, gloves and gowns from the stockpile to Washington state, which was hit early with a coronavirus outbreak. But state officials even then said the supplies weren’t enough.Federal contracting records show that HHS had made an initial order March 12 for $4.8 million of N95 masks from 3M, the largest U.S.-based manufacturer, which had ramped up production weeks earlier in response to the pandemic. HHS followed up with a larger $173 million order on March 21, but those contracts don’t require 3M to start making deliveries to the national stockpile until the end of April. That’s after the White House has projected the pandemic will reach its peak.On Thursday, Trump threatened in a Tweet to “hit 3M hard” through a Defense Production Act order, saying the company “will have a big price to pay!” He gave no specifics.HHS declined this past week to say how many N95 masks it has on hand. But as of March 31, the White House said more than 11.6 million had been distributed to state and local governments from the national stockpile — about 90% of what was available at the start of the year.Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS, testified before Congress last month that the country would need roughly 3.5 billion N-95 respirators to get through the pandemic, but the national supply chain then had just about 1% of that amount.Greg Burel, director of the Strategic National Stockpile from 2007 until his retirement at the start of this year, said the cache was only ever intended to serve as a short-term “bridge-stock.”The stockpile was created in 1999 to prevent supply-chain disruptions for the predicted Y2K computer problems. It expanded after 9/11 to prepare for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attacks. Congress provided money in 2006 to prepare for a potential influenza pandemic, though Burel said much of that stock was used during the H1N1 flu outbreak three years later.“There’s never enough money to buy everything that we want to see on those shelves,” said Burel, who stressed the stockpile uses its annual funding to prepare for a wide array of potential threats.“Most of the time, commercially available products like masks can be bought in quantity at the time of an event.”This time, it hasn’t worked out that way. As AP reported last month, much of the world’s supply of N95 masks and other basic medical supplies is made in China, the first nation hit by COVID-19. As a result, the Chinese government required its producers to reserve N95 respirators for domestic use. China resumed exports of the precious masks only in recent days.Experts are now worried the U.S. will also soon exhaust its supply of ventilators, which can cost upward of $12,000 each.The White House said Tuesday that it had already distributed nearly half the breathing machines in the stockpile, which at the beginning of March had 16,660; some of them dated back to the flurry of post-9/11 purchasing. An additional 2,425 were out for maintenance.Cuomo said New York may need as many as 40,000 ventilators to deal with the outbreak that is already overwhelming hospitals there.Throughout March, governors and mayors of big cities urged Trump to use his authority under the Defense Production Act to direct private companies to ramp up production of ventilators. It wasn’t until last week that Trump finally said he would use that power to order General Motors to begin manufacturing ventilators — work the company had already announced was underway.The federal government had made an effort to prepare for a surge in the need for ventilators, but it was allowed to languish. Since 2014, HHS has paid a private company, Respironics Inc., $13.8 million to develop a cheaper, less complicated ventilator that could be bought in bulk to replenish the national stockpile. In September, HHS placed a $32.8 million order with the Dutch-owned company for 10,000 of the new model, set for delivery by 2022, federal contracts show.Respironics’ parent company, Royal Philips, said it’s planning to double U.S. production of ventilators to 2,000 a week by the end of May.Steve Klink, a spokesman for Royal Philips in Amsterdam, said the company is now focused on producing its other commercial models and will deliver the first ventilators to the national stockpile by August, long after the White House projects COVID-19 cases will peak.Trump, who pledged on March 27 that his administration would ensure that 100,000 additional ventilators would be made available “within 100 days,” said on Thursday that he’ll use the Defense Production Act to order Respironics and other ventilator makers to step up production.It’s not clear that Trump’s order would translate into the 100,000 new ventilators he promised. In a House Oversight and Reform Committee briefing last week, top Federal Emergency Management Agency officials hedged, saying 100,000 ventilators would be available by late June “at the earliest.”Cuomo predicted on Friday that New York would run out within days. With coronavirus deaths in his state surging, the governor vowed to use his authority to seize ventilators, masks and protective gear from private hospitals that aren’t utilizing them.Meanwhile, federal health authorities are lowering standards.New guidance from the Food and Drug Administration allows hospitals to use emergency ventilators typically used in ambulances and anesthesia gas machines in place of standard ventilators. The agency also said nightstand CPAP machines used to treat sleep apnea and snoring could also be used to keep coronavirus patients breathing, as a last resort.The CDC advised health care workers last month to use homemade masks or bandanas if they run out of proper gear. Across the country, hospitals have issued urgent pleas for volunteers who know how to sew.President Trump provided his own input, suggesting that Americans without access to factory-produced masks could cover their faces with scarves.“A scarf is highly recommended by the professionals,” Trump said during a White House briefing Wednesday. “And I think, in a certain way, depending on the fabric — I think, in a certain way, a scarf is better. It’s actually better.”"

cd7935273e1a7f6abe1498f8d50b2dd5,"Giddy with joy and finally free to speak out, vast throngs of demonstrators turned Zimbabwe’s capital into a carnival ground on Saturday in a peaceful outpouring of disdain for President Robert Mugabe and calls for him to quit immediately.Still clinging to his now-powerless post, the longtime leader was scheduled on Sunday to discuss his expected exit with the military command that put him under house arrest.People in Harare clambered onto tanks and other military vehicles moving slowly through the crowds, danced around soldiers walking in city streets and surged in the thousands toward the building where Mugabe held official functions, a symbol of the rule of the 93-year-old man who took power after independence from white minority rule in 1980. There, in a situation that could have become tense, the protesters instead showed deference to the small number of soldiers blocking their way and eventually dispersed.It was a historic day when the old Zimbabwe, a once-promising African nation with a disintegrating economy and a mood of fear about the consequences of challenging Mugabe, became something new, with a population united, at least temporarily, in its fervor for change and a joyful openness that would have seemed fanciful even a few days ago.The euphoria, however, will eventually subside, and much depends on the behind-the-scenes maneuvering to get Mugabe to officially resign, jumpstart a new leadership that could seek to be inclusive and reduce perceptions that the military staged a coup against Mugabe. The president was to meet military commanders on Sunday in a second round of talks, state broadcaster ZBC reported.“The common enemy is Robert Mugabe. That’s for starters,” said 37-year-old Talent Mudzamiri, an opposition supporter who was born soon after Zimbabwe’s independence.He had a warning for whoever takes over Zimbabwe: “If the next leader does the same, we are going to come out again.”Many Zimbabweans believe the most likely candidate will be Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former vice president with close military ties whose dismissal by Mugabe triggered the intervention of the armed forces, which sent troops and tanks into the streets this week, effectively taking over the country. The increasing presidential ambitions of Mugabe’s wife Grace, a polarizing figure who denounced Mnangagwa amid a factional battle within the ruling ZANU-PF party, alarmed those who feared a dynastic succession.“Leadership is not sexually transmitted,” read a poster at the Harare rallies. Other signs denounced “Gucci Grace,” a reference to the first lady’s record of high-end shopping expeditions outside Zimbabwe, which suffered hyperinflation in the past and is currently struggling with a cash shortage and massive unemployment.The discussions over Mugabe’s fate come ahead of a key ruling party congress next month, as well as scheduled elections next year.The president, who is believed to be staying at his private home in Harare, a well-guarded compound known as the Blue Roof, is reported to have asked for more time in office. He has been deserted by most of his allies, with others arrested. The ruling party has turned on him, asking for a Central Committee meeting this weekend to recall both him and his wife, who heads the women’s league of the party. Impeachment is also a possibility when Parliament resumes Tuesday.Even as concerns remained about who next would be in charge and what freedoms might be available if the military lingers in power — or if Mugabe’s recently fired deputy leads a new government — people reveled Saturday in the rare chance to express themselves freely.In Harare, people ran through intersections, raising their arms in triumph. Young men shouted, laughed and embraced. Others danced on top of moving buses. One man stripped to his underwear and danced on a car roof.Some marchers had posters with an image of the military commander who swept in to take control, with the slogan: “Go, go, our general!!!” Marchers handed flags to soldiers, who accepted and waved.“It’s like Christmas,” said one marcher, Fred Mubay, who said Zimbabweans have been suffering for a long time.Veterans of the long war against white minority rule, once close allies of Mugabe, took part in the demonstration, along with opposition activists who long have faced police crackdowns by the Mugabe government. Thousands gathered for speeches at the Zimbabwe Grounds, where Zimbabweans gathered to cheer Mugabe’s return from exile in 1980 after the liberation war.Elizabeth Sithole, 60, said her husband died in 2004, she lives with her children in a 2-room apartment and her business selling vegetables has collapsed.

The trial, only the third such undertaking in American history, is unfolding at the start of the election year, a time of deep political division in the nation. Four of the senators sitting in judgment on Trump are running for the Democratic Party’s nomination to challenge him in the fall.“Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!” intoned the Senate’s sergeant at arms, calling the proceedings to order just past noon.Senators filled the chamber, an unusual sight in itself, sitting silently under strict rules that prohibit talking or cellphones, for a trial that will test not only Trump’s presidency but also the nation’s three branches of power and its system of checks and balances.The Constitution mandates the chief justice serve as the presiding officer, and Roberts made the short trip across the street from the Supreme Court to the Capitol. He has long insisted judges are not politicians and is expected to serve as a referee for the proceedings. Senators rose quickly when he appeared in his plain black robe.“Will all senators now stand, and remain standing, and raise their right hand,” Roberts said.“Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?”The senators responded they would, and then they lined up to sign an oath book.Trump faces two charges after the House voted to impeach him last month. One, that he abused his presidential power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid to the country as leverage. Trump is also charged with obstructing Congress’ ensuing probe.The president insists he did nothing wrong, and he dismissed the trial anew on Thursday at the White House: “It’s totally partisan. It’s a hoax.”Eventual acquittal is expected in the Republican-controlled Senate. However, new revelations are mounting about Trump’s actions toward Ukraine.The Government Accountability Office said Thursday that the White House violated federal law in withholding the security assistance to Ukraine, which shares a border with hostile Russia.At the same time, an indicted associate of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas, has turned over to prosecutors new documents linking the president to the shadow foreign policy being run by Giuliani.The developments applied fresh pressure to senators to call more witnesses for the trial, a main source of contention that is still to be resolved. The White House has instructed officials not to comply with subpoenas from Congress requesting witnesses or other information.“What is the president hiding? What is he afraid of?’’ asked Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.“The gravity of these charges is self-evident,” he said. “The House of Representatives has accused the president of trying to shake down a foreign leader for personal gain.”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the new information from Parnas demands an investigation, which she doesn’t expect from Trump’s attorney general. “This is an example of all of the president’s henchmen, and I hope that the senators do not become part of the president’s henchmen.”Before the swearing-in, House Democrats prosecuting the case stood before the Senate and Rep. Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee formally read the articles of impeachment.Seven lawmakers, led by Schiff and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, made the solemn walk across the Capitol for a second day.All eyes were on Schiff as he stood at a lectern in the well of the chamber, a space usually reserved for senators.“House Resolution 755 Impeaching Donald John Trump, president of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors,” he began, reading the nine pages.The other House prosecutors stood in a row to his side.Senators said later that when Roberts appeared the solemnity of the occasion took hold. Security was tight at the Capitol.“I thought this is a historic moment, and you could have heard a pin drop,” said Republican John Cornyn of Texas. “And so I think the gravity of what are undertaking I think was sinking in for all of us.”Republican House Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took a far different view of the charges and proceedings.He opened the chamber decrying Pelosi’s decision to hand out “souvenir pens” on Wednesday after she signed the resolution to transmit the charges to the Senate.“This final display neatly distilled the House’s entire partisan process into one perfect visual,” McConnell said. “It was a transparently partisan process from beginning to end.”GOP Sen. James Inhofe was absent, home in Oklahoma for a family medical issue, but plans to take the oath when he returns as the full trial begins next week, his office said.The Senate will issue a formal summons to the White House to appear, with the president’s legal team expected to respond by Saturday. Opening arguments will begin on Tuesday.The president suggested recently that he would be open to a quick vote to simply dismiss the charges, but sufficient Republican support is lacking for that.Instead, the president’s team expects a trial lasting no more than two weeks, according to senior administration officials. That would be far shorter than the trial of President Bill Clinton, in 1999, or the first one, of President Andrew Johnson, in 1868. Both were acquitted.It would take a super-majority of senators, 67 of the 100, to convict the president. Republicans control the chamber, 53-47, but it takes just 51 votes during the trial to approve rules, call witnesses or dismiss the charges.A group of four Republican senators is working to ensure there will be votes on the possibility of witnesses, though it’s not at all certain a majority will prevail for new testimony.Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee are among those involved.“I tend to believe having additional information would be helpful,” Collins said in a statement. “It is likely that I would support a motion to call witnesses.”Romney said he wants to hear from John Bolton, the former national security adviser at the White House, who others have said raised alarms about the alternative foreign policy toward Ukraine being run by Giuliani.The House managers are a diverse group with legal, law enforcement and military experience, including Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Sylvia Garcia of Texas, Val Demings of Florida, Jason Crow of Colorado and Zoe Lofgren of California.Two are freshmen — Crow a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Garcia a former judge in Houston. Demings is the former police chief of Orlando, and Jeffries is a lawyer and member of party leadership. Lofgren has the rare credential of having worked on a congressional staff during President Richard Nixon’s impeachment — he resigned before the full House voted on the charges — and then being an elected lawmaker during Clinton’s.(With Inputs from Associated Press)"
bba7417beb7301a20a717e1048d2e338,"California sues largest manufacturer of e-cigarettesThe US state of California has filed a lawsuit against Juul Labs Inc., the largest manufacturer of e-cigarettes, alleging that the firm targeted young people and teenagers with its advertising despite the fact that sales of its products were prohibited to people under 21 years of age. ""We've worked too hard, committed our hard-earned money for too long combating harmful tobacco use to stand idly by as we now lose Californians to vaping and nicotine addiction,"" Efe news reported citing Attorney General Xavier Becerra as saying at a news conference here on Monday.""Juul adopted the tobacco industry's infamous playbook, employing advertisements that had no regard for public health and searching out vulnerable targets,"" he added.The complaint was presented jointly by the California state government, the city and county of Los Angeles, and in it the plaintiffs have claimed that, besides targeting young people with its advertising, the firm did not warn the public about the fact that its products expose users to potentially dangerous chemicals and to the risk of cancer, birth defects and reproductive damage.In addition, according to the plaintiffs, Juul did not verify the age of consumers of its products and violated privacy laws of minors by saving their e-mail addresses and using them to send those people more ads.Specifically, the lawsuit says that the e-cigarette manufacturer publicized its mango, mint, cream and pepper flavours, which are especially popular among teens.E-cigarettes are facing increasing restrictions in the US, with prohibitions on the local and state level and the threat by President Donald Trump to prohibit marketing the products on the national level.Last week, the US's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report in which it raised to 42 the death toll for people who have died from lung damage caused by consumption of electronic cigarettes, along with more than 2,000 cases of non-lethal lung damage.Vaping among teens has been steadily increasing despite efforts by health officials to limit it, with more than 25 per cent of US high school students using e-cigarettes, according to the CDC.ALSO READ: Trump had no chest pain nor evaluated for acute issues; says presidential physicianALSO READ: Subpoena requesting Trump's financial records temporarily blocked​"

9fe6cd8facd48ae314f3078fc73c9368,"Protests broke out in Baghdad soon after Iranian missile strikeTensions are high between USA and Iran ever since top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani was killed in US drone strike in Baghdad. Iran launched missile attacks at US bases in Iraq soon thereafter and leaders of both countries were aggressive in their statements. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah al-Khamenei called to end of ""corruptive"" US presence in the Middle East, while Iran President Hassan Rouhani was more combative as he warned the US that its ""foot"" will be ""cut"" from the region. By all accounts, Iran seemed eager for a 'revenge'.But here's why Iran may have 'deliberately missed' hitting US targets. Missile attacks on al-Assad US base and another base at Erbil were huge signals that Iran was in no mood to back down after the US had eliminated Qasem Soleimani, who had a huge influence and was popular in Iran.Image Source : APAl-Assad airbase in IraqAl-Assad airbase in IraqPrior to the attack on al-Assad airbase, Iranian rockets hit the Green Zone in Baghdad. Green Zone is an area in Baghdad where foreign embassies and Iraq government buildings are located. The missiles landed near the US Embassy. However, there were no reports of any casualty in all these attacks initiated by Iran. This was confirmed by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.""We suffered no casualties. All our soldiers are safe and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases,"" said Trump in his address on Iran.Image Source : APUS President during his address on IranUS President during his address on IranNews agency Reuters has now cited anonymous US government sources to say that Iran took care to 'deliberately misfire' the rockets in order to avoid casualties. This is why, the source told Reuters, that Iranian missiles managed to hit only certain parts of US bases and there were no casualties.Such a move looks logical as Iran, in one stroke, has been able to show its citizens that it is not sitting silent after Qasem Soleimani's killing. However, by ensuring that there were no US casualties, Iran has given Donald Trump a reason to NOT unleash full military might of the US on Iran.US President Donald Trump seemed to voice conciliatory sentiments on Wednesday as he addressed USA on the situation with respect to Iran.During Trump's address to US on Iran on Wednesday, he said that US was ""willing to embrace peace with those who seek it"" and that ""Iran seems to be backing down"". Both of these statements are being seen as an indication that US is unwilling to fully engage with Iran militarily."
ace118d876cd18dc803c6435e4690356,"India’s bid for permanent UNSC membership matter of discussion: Linda Thomas-GreenfieldUS President Joe Biden’s pick for the ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, on Wednesday did not explicitly commit the support of the new administration for India to be a permanent member of the Security Council. Three previous administrations, that of George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, had publicly said that the United States supports India’s bid to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.However, Thomas-Greenfield, who has spent more than 35 years in foreign service before being nominated to the position, during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told lawmakers that this is a matter of ongoing discussion.“Do you think India, Germany, Japan, should be (permanent) members (of the UN Security Council),” Senator Jeff Merkley from Oregon asked during her confirmation hearing for the position of the US Ambassador to the UN. Biden has named it as a Cabinet-ranking position.“I think there has been some discussions about them being members of the Security Council and there are some strong arguments for that,” she said.“But I also know that there are others who disagree within their regions that they should be the representative of their region. That, too, is an ongoing discussion,” she said in an apparent reference to the Coffee Club or United for Consensus.Comprising countries like Italy, Pakistan, Mexico and Egypt, the Coffee Club has opposed the permanent membership bid of India, Japan, Germany and Brazil. President Biden in his campaign policy document last year had reiterated its promise of supporting India as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.“Recognising India’s growing role on the world stage, the Obama-Biden Administration formally declared US support for India’s membership in a reformed and expanded United Nations Security Council,” Biden Campaign’s policy document on Indian-Americans had said last August.Thomas-Greenfield, in response to another question, favoured reforms in the UN Security Council. India is currently its non-permanent member for a two-year term that began in January this year.“I think there is general agreement across the board that reforms are needed in the Security Council. What those reforms will be and how they will be implemented, I think remains to be decided but you know changing the number of members that happened we move from 11 to 15 some years ago and there are efforts to push for more permanent members, and those discussions are ongoing,” she said.She was responding to a question from Senator Merkley.“I wanted to start by asking about the Security Council itself. At the same time that China and Russian often stymie actions in the Security Council. The Security Council is decreasingly representative of the geopolitical landscape with key powers like India, Germany, Japan not included as permanent members,” he said.“How do you approach the question of the Security Council? How do you consider that perhaps it needs to be reformed? How do you believe it can be made more effective and functional,” Merkley asked.Also Read: China pushes fringe theories on pandemic origins, virus "
cd655b682d2f37a9ef682789eb06275c,"Hawaii is the first state to prepare the public for the possibility of a ballistic missile strike from North Korea. The state's Emergency Management Agency on Friday announced a public education campaign about what to do. Hawaii lawmakers have been urging emergency management officials to update Cold War-era plans for coping with a nuclear attack as North Korea develops nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles that can reach the islands.Starting in November, Hawaii will begin monthly tests of an ""attack-warning"" siren the state hasn't heard since the end of the Cold War in the 1980s. The wailing siren will be tested on the first working day of each month, after a test of an ""attention-alert"" steady tone siren with which residents are already familiar.Informational brochures, along with TV, radio and internet announcements will help educate the public about the new siren sound and provide preparedness guidance. ""If they're not educated, they could actually be frightened by it,"" agency Executive Director Toby Clairmont said of needing several months to introduce the new siren.Because it would take a missile 15 minutes maybe 20 minutes to arrive, the instructions to the public are simple: ""Get inside, stay inside and stay tuned,"" said Vern Miyagi, agency administrator. ""You will not have time to pick up your family and go to a shelter and all that kind of stuff. ... It has to be automatic.""He stressed that his agency is simply trying to stay ahead of a ""very unlikely"" scenario, but it's a possibility that Hawaii can't ignore.The Hawaii Tourism Authority supports preparing for disasters, but it is concerned that misinformation about bracing for a North Korea attack could scare travellers from visiting the islands, spokeswoman Charlene Chan said in a statement: ""The effect of such a downtown would ultimately be felt by residents who rely on tourism's success for their livelihood.""With that in mind, Miyagi reiterated, ""Hawaii is still safe.""Hawaii residents, who already face hazards including from tsunami and hurricanes, are familiar with disaster preparedness. Because it's currently hurricane season, residents should already have an emergency kit that includes 14-days of food and water.""It also works for this type of scenario,"" Lt. Col. Charles Anthony, spokesman for the Hawaii State Department of Defense.Hawaii officials surveyed 28 U.S. states and cities about what they're doing for the North Korea threat. ""They think it's too soon,"" Clairmont said. But counterparts in California have contacted him asking for guidance now that they are starting to look at a similar effort, Clairmont said."

c10bac75e4d1c41bde7265b875446238,"Families evacuated from Kabul, Afghanistan, walk through the terminal before boarding a bus after they arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport, in Chantilly, Va.At least 50,000 Afghans are expected to be admitted into the United States following the fall of Kabul as part of an “enduring commitment” to help people who aided the American war effort and others who are particularly vulnerable under Taliban rule, the secretary of homeland security said Friday.Tens of thousands of Afghans have already made it through security vetting and arrived in the U.S. to begin the process of resettlement. Exactly how many more will come and how long it will take remain open questions, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said as he outlined the effort.“Our commitment is an enduring one,” he told reporters. “This is not just a matter of the next several weeks. We will not rest until we have accomplished the ultimate goal.”Mayorkas and other Biden administration officials are providing the most detailed look to date at what began as a frantic and chaotic effort to evacuate U.S. citizens, permanent residents and Afghans before the Aug. 30 withdrawal of American troops and the end of the country’s longest war.Jack Markell, former governor of Delaware, will serve as coordinator of what the White House is calling “Operation Allies Welcome.” He will work alongside the National Security Council, Domestic Policy Council, DHS, and other federal agencies “to ensure vulnerable Afghans who pass screening and vetting reviews are safely and efficiently resettled here in the United States,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House principal deputy press secretary. The appointment is expected to run through the end of the year.Nearly 130,000 were airlifted out of Afghanistan in one of the largest mass evacuations in U.S. history. Many of those people are still in transit, undergoing security vetting and screening in other countries, including Germany, Spain, Kuwait and Qatar.Mayorkas said there have been some evacuees who have been stopped at transit countries because of “derogatory information,” though he provided no details. It is unclear what happens to any Afghans who don’t make it through the security screening at the overseas transit points, though the secretary said the U.S. is working with its allies to address the issue.More than 40,000 have arrived in the U.S. so far. Mayorkas said about 20% are either U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The rest are people who have received or are in the process of receiving what’s known as a Special Immigrant Visa — for those who worked for the American military or NATO as interpreters or in some other capacity — and Afghans considered particularly vulnerable under Taliban rule, such as journalists and employees of nongovernmental organizations.“We have a moral imperative to protect them, to support those who have supported this nation,” said Mayorkas, who as a child came to the U.S. as a refugee from Cuba with his family.While he said the U.S. expected to admit at least 50,000 Afghans, he suggested there was no set limit or a specific time frame.“Our mission is not accomplished until we have safely evacuated all U.S. citizens who wish to leave Afghanistan or lawful permanent residents, all individuals who have assisted the United States in Afghanistan,” he said. “This effort will not end until we achieve that goal.”Though the U.S. airlift has ended, Taliban officials have said they would allow people with valid travel papers to leave, and they may feel compelled not to backtrack as they seek to continue receiving foreign aid and run the government.Most of the Afghans who have arrived in the U.S. are being housed on military bases around the country, receiving medical treatment, assistance with submitting immigration applications and other services aimed at helping them settle in the country.There were more than 25,000 Afghan evacuees at eight bases with capacity for twice as many, said Air Force Gen.

At least 35 people had died and 24 were injured, but Indonesian officials said they were still collecting information from devastated areas.In a video released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, a girl trapped in the wreckage of a house cried out for help and said her mother was alive but unable to move out. “Please help me, it’s hurt,” the girl told rescuers, who replied that they desperately wanted to help her.In the video, the rescuers said an excavator was needed to save them. Other images in the video showed a severed bridge and damaged and even flattened houses. TV stations reported the earthquake damaged part of a hospital and patients were moved to an emergency tent outside.Another video showed a father cried hopeless, asking help from people to save his children buried under tons of his house rubble. “My children there... they are trapped inside, please help,” he cried in panic.About 2,000 displaced people were evacuated to several temporary shelters. The magnitude 6.2 quake early Friday was centered 36 kilometers (22 miles) south of West Sulawesi province’s Mamuju district, at a depth of 18 kilometers (11 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey said.At least 62 houses, a public health center and a military office were damaged in Mamuju and landslides were set off in three locations and blocked a main road connecting Mamuju to the Majene district, said Raditya Jati, the disaster agency’s spokesperson. He said the agency is still collecting data from areas struck by the quake.On Thursday, a magnitude 5.9 quake hit under the sea in the same region, damaging several homes but causing no apparent casualties.Indonesia, a vast archipelago of 260 million people, is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.ALSO READ | 26 missing, at least 13 dead in Indonesia landslides"

The Houthis have claimed responsibility for several drone and missile attacks on the UAE that have widened Yemen's 7-year-old civil war and fueled regional tensions.In a short statement just before midnight Wednesday on Twitter, the Emirati Defense Ministry said it had destroyed three “hostile drones” that targeted the UAE at dawn. It said the interception occurred “away from populated areas,” without elaborating.The Houthis have been battling a Saudi-led coalition that includes the UAE since 2015 after the rebels took control of Yemen's capital, Sanaa. The war reached Emirati soil for the first time last month when the Houthis fired drones and missiles at the country. US and Emirati forces have jointly intercepted the past two aerial attacks, including one earlier this week as Israel's president began a historic visit to the Gulf Arab country. Another attack in mid-January killed three workers from India and Pakistan and wounded six others.There was no immediate comment from Yemen's Houthis on any drone launches Thursday. However, the rebel group's media office posted a claim from a largely unknown group called the “True Promise Brigade” that said it launched four drones at the UAE in retaliation for its “interference” in the region, without offering evidence to support its claim.The UAE said it was ready “to deal with any threats and is taking all necessary measures to protect the state.”The escalation has threatened the UAE's reputation as a haven for international business in a region mired in conflict and collapse.

9da2cb495dbce8921c52855ff6edda19,"Next 30 days very vital against coronavirus pandemic, says TrumpUS President Donald Trump has said that the next 30 days are very vital for America in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, as the confirmed cases of those infected by the deadly disease soured to 164,000 and fatalities crossed 3,100 in the country. His remarks came a day after he extended the ""social distancing"" guidelines until April 30, expecting the peak death rate from COVID-19 to hit the country in two weeks.  ""Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days, and this is a very vital 30 days,"" Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on Monday, his second consecutive one in the Rose Garden. More than 250 million of America's 330 million population are in the stay at home order and more than two dozen states have been notified as major disaster declaration, in addition to the declaration of national emergency. The Army has been roped in to build makeshift hospitals at convention centers, racetracks, public parks across the country. Auto companies have stopped manufacturing cars and instead of manufacturing ventilators and other equipment to be used in the treatment of hundreds and thousands of Americans who are expected to fall ill due to COVID-19; something which was seen only during wartime. ""We are sort of putting it all on the line this 30 days, so important because we have to get back, but the more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis, and that is the time we're waiting for,"" Trump told reporters, reflecting upon the seriousness of the pandemic that has hit the US hardest among all the countries. So far more than a million Americans have been tested for coronavirus, which is the highest for any country and its testing rate has now increased to 100,000 per day. The President said that he will announce a tightening of the guidelines, which he argued is having a big impact. Manufacturing of testing kits and medical equipment including ventilators, face masks have been ramped up, he said, adding that there will be no shortage in the coming weeks. Dr Deborah Bix, a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, had a day earlier said that even with all the present steps, the death toll in the US could be between 100,000 to 200,000. On Monday she said that the analysis of the fresh data would be presented before the president on Tuesday. Trump told reporters that he is looking into the possibility of everybody wearing a mask in the public. ""We're getting certainly the number of masks that you need. We are in the process of talking about things. I saw his suggestion on that, so we'll take a look at it for a period of time. Not forever. I mean, you know, we want our country back. We're not going to be wearing masks forever, but it could be for a short period of time after we get back into gear,"" he said. Responding to a question on suggestions about using GPS for social distancing, he described this as a very severe idea. ""I've been hearing about it. GPS. What happens, a siren goes off if you get too close to somebody? That's pretty severe,"" he said. Trump told reporters that saving the lives of the people is his top priority, followed by the nation's economy. ""My focus is saving lives, that is the only focus I can have. We are going to bring the economy back and we will bring it back fast,"" he said. ""The economy is number two on my list. First I want to save a lot of lives. I am going to get the economy back. I think the economy is going to come back very fast,"" he said. Trump said that the extension of social distancing measure until April 30 is based on modelling that shows the peak in fatalities will not arrive for another two weeks. ""They say modelling also shows that by very vigorously following these guidelines, we can save more than one million American lives. Think of that, one million American lives. Our future is in our own hands, and the choices and sacrifices we make will determine the fate of this virus and really the fate of our victory,"" the President added. According to reports, the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic has soared past 35,000 while the number of confirmed cases topped 750,000 globally. Also Read | Coronavirus Live UpdatesAlso Read | Over 12,000 fake N95 masks seized from Bengaluru warehouse​   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_6906471616 = { ""file"": ""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_9dwmaik3_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_9dwmaik3_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""US President Donald Trump signs $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_6906471616 = ''; jwsetup_6906471616(); function jwsetup_6906471616() { jwvidplayer_6906471616 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_6906471616"").setup(jwconfig_6906471616); jwvidplayer_6906471616.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_6906471616, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_9dwmaik3\"", ns_st_pr=\""US President Donald Trump signs $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""US President Donald Trump signs $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""US President Donald Trump signs $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2020-03-28\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2020-03-28\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_9dwmaik3_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_6906471616.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_6906471616.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_6906471616.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_6906471616.stop(); jwvidplayer_6906471616.remove(); jwvidplayer_6906471616 = ''; jwsetup_6906471616(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_6906471616.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_6906471616.stop(); jwvidplayer_6906471616.remove(); jwvidplayer_6906471616 = ''; jwsetup_6906471616(); return; }); jwvidplayer_6906471616.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6906471616.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6906471616.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6906471616.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6906471616.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_6906471616.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  ​"
9a21e3fcf2abe80ac1f3e791e09713d3,"Chancellor Angela Merkel cast her vote Sunday in Berlin, confident of a fourth term in office with her conservative bloc enjoying a wide lead in the final polls, while the nationalist, anti-migrant Alternative for Germany party seemed poised to win seats in parliament for the first time.Merkel campaigned on her record as chancellor for 12 years, emphasizing the country’s record-low unemployment, strong economic growth, balanced budget and growing international importance.That’s helped keep her conservative bloc well atop the polls ahead of the center-left Social Democrats of challenger Martin Schulz.In Berlin, which also hosted its annual marathon Sunday, many streets were blocked and some voters had to cross the marathon’s route as runners zigzagged their way through the German capital. A festive mood emerged, with local bands playing on street corners and bystanders cheering and applauding.Merkel arrived in the early afternoon to vote with her husband Joachim Sauer, whose umbrella shielded them from the cold drizzle. Merkel nodded and smiled at reporters as they left the polling station but made no comment.Schulz voted with his wife Inge in his hometown of Wuerselen in western Germany.Merkel’s conservative Christian Democratic Union and its sister party, the Bavaria-only Christian Social Union, have governed the country for the last four years with the Social Democrats in a so-called “grand coalition.” Most forecasts suggest that coalition will win another majority in Sunday’s election outcome, but several different coalition government combinations could be possible.The latest polls had Merkel’s conservative bloc at 34 to 37 percent support, the center-left Social Democrats with 21 to 22 percent and the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany, or AfD, with 10 to 13 percent support, enough to get into parliament.If that happens, it would make AfD the farthest right-wing party in parliament for nearly six decades.In addition to the AfD, the Greens, the Free Democratic Party and the Left Party were all poised to enter parliament with poll numbers between 8 and 11 percent.Many of the country’s 61.5 million voters had remained undecided until the very last moment, according to the polls. That included Bernhard Sommerfeld, a 62-year-old book seller who cast his vote Sunday morning in Berlin.“I was really undecided,” said Sommerfeld, who declined to say who he voted for. “It was very difficult.”Voter turnout around noontime was up in many parts of the country compared to four years ago, the German news agency dpa reported.In the northern city of Hamburg, some 37.4 percent had voted compared to 35.4 percent in 2013. In Munich, 57.1 percent had cast their vote at noon, more than the 44.3 percent four years ago.Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, appealed to his fellow citizens to go out and vote, because “these elections are also about the future of democracy and the future of Europe.”Countries across Europe have seen a rise of anti-migrant and populist parties in recent elections and several German pollsters have forecast that AfD may come in as third-strongest party.The AfD has led an aggressive campaign dominated by hostile slogans against the more than 1 million, mostly Muslim migrants who arrived in Germany in the last two years. They’re aiming to grab votes from conservatives who in the past have voted for Merkel’s party, but are unhappy with her welcoming stance toward refugees."

Thus, the party decided to recall him, if he refuses to go,  he would have to face a confidence vote in parliament.The date for this has already been set for February 22, a BBC report said.ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the issue was causing ""disunity and discord"" as Zuma faced a number of corruption charges after nine years in power.Ramaphosa on Sunday said that the people ""want this matter to be finalised"" and that the ANC would comply.Acknowledging that his party was going through ""a period of difficulty, disunity and discord"", he said he was seeking ""a new beginning"".Last week, an NEC meeting was called off as Zuma and Ramaphosa directly met for talks to reach a conclusion.Zuma faces the allegations of corruption as his links in recent years to a wealthy India-born Gupta family is believed to have influenced the government.However, both the President and the Guptas have denied the allegations levelled against them.Zuma has not been found guilty in any of the 18 corruption charges levelled against him. The allegations stem from a 1990s arms deal which were dropped before he became President in 2009, following incumbent Thabo Mbeki's resignation in 2008.(With inputs from IANS)"
212f4b08b0342eda92174c45b697035e,"Oxford COVID-19 vaccine human trial reveals vaccine is 'safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic'An experimental COVID-19 vaccine, being developed by the University of Oxford, is safe and produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials in healthy volunteers, according to trial results published in UK based medical Journal ‘The Lancet’. It said the vaccine, called AZD1222, developed by pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and scientists at Britain's University of Oxford, did not prompt any serious side effects and induced strong antibody and T-cell immune responses.Scientists at Oxford University said that they found their experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced a dual immune response in people aged 18 to 55 that lasted at least two months after they were immunized. The vaccine was tested on 1077 people in phase I and II of the human trials.  Result published at The Lancet journal said the vaccine triggered a T-cell response within 14 days of vaccination and an antibody response within 28 days.  A T-cell response refers to the attack of the white blood cells on the cells that are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.""The Phase I/II data for our coronavirus vaccine shows that the vaccine did not lead to any unexpected reactions and had a similar safety profile to previous vaccines of this type. The immune responses observed following vaccination are in line with what previous animal studies have shown are associated with protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, although we must continue with our rigorous clinical trial programme to confirm this in humans,” said Professor Andrew Pollard, Chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford University and co-author of the study.Taking to Twitter, Richard Horton, editor at The Lancet, said, ""The phase 1/2 Oxford COVID-19 vaccine trial is now published. The vaccine is safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic. Congratulations to Pedro Folegatti and colleagues. These results are extremely encouraging.""The paper in The Lancet was much anticipated as the Oxford University’s experimental vaccine has been touted as one of the frontrunners among over 20 vaccine candidates that have entered the human trial stage.Currently, Phase-III trials have begun in South Africa and Brazil. These countries were chosen for the trials to enable adequate participation in trials. The phase III part of the study involves assessing how the vaccine works in a large number of people over the age of 18 . This group will allow assessment of how well the vaccine works to protect people from becoming infected with COVID-19, University of Oxford had said.Meanwhile, the government of UK has already ordered 90 million doses of the vaccine being developed by the Oxford University. While the latest results are highly encouraging, it will be a little early to say that coronavirus now has a cure as phase trials are still underway.Nearly two dozen potential vaccines are in various stages of human testing worldwide, with a handful entering necessary late-stage testing to prove effectiveness.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_4903111114 = { ""file"": ""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_9wdguxab_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_9wdguxab_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Might have COVID-19 vaccine by end of this year or early next year: AIIMS"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""121"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_4903111114 = ''; jwsetup_4903111114(); function jwsetup_4903111114() { jwvidplayer_4903111114 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_4903111114"").setup(jwconfig_4903111114); jwvidplayer_4903111114.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_4903111114, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_9wdguxab\"", ns_st_pr=\""Might have COVID-19 vaccine by end of this year or early next year: AIIMS\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Might have COVID-19 vaccine by end of this year or early next year: AIIMS\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Might have COVID-19 vaccine by end of this year or early next year: AIIMS\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2020-07-20\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2020-07-20\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_9wdguxab_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_4903111114.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_4903111114.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_4903111114.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_4903111114.stop(); jwvidplayer_4903111114.remove(); jwvidplayer_4903111114 = ''; jwsetup_4903111114(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_4903111114.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_4903111114.stop(); jwvidplayer_4903111114.remove(); jwvidplayer_4903111114 = ''; jwsetup_4903111114(); return; }); jwvidplayer_4903111114.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_4903111114.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_4903111114.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_4903111114.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_4903111114.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_4903111114.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }   "

0324ffb30a5f47b9f3c6c1b7466897e7,"Joe Biden speaks about govt's COVID response, in South Court Auditorium in Eisenhower Executive Office Building on White House Campus in Washington on Jan 13, 2022. President Joe Biden on Thursday (January 13) announced that the government will double to 1 billion the rapid, at-home COVID-19 tests to be distributed free to Americans, along with “high-quality masks,” as he highlighted his efforts to “surge” resources to help the country weather the spike in coronavirus cases. Biden also announced that starting next week 1,000 military medical personnel will begin deploying across the country to help overwhelmed medical facilities ease staff shortages due to the highly transmissible omicron variant. Speaking at the White House, he said six additional military medical teams will be deployed to Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Rhode Island. Many facilities are struggling because their workers are in at-home quarantines due to the virus at the same time as a nationwide spike in COVID-19 cases. The new deployments will be on top of other federal medical personnel who have already been sent to states to help with acute shortages. Biden acknowledged that, “I know we’re all frustrated as we enter this new year” as virus cases reach new heights. But he insisted that it remains “a pandemic of the unvaccinated.” Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people test positive for the virus, but Biden noted medical figures showing that people are far less likely to suffer serious illness and death if they’ve received a shot: “What happens after that could not be more different.” Biden’s comments come as his administration’s focus is shifting to easing disruptions from the spike in cases that is also contributing to grocery shortages and flight cancellations, rather than preventing the transmission of the virus. ALSO READ: United States: Joe Biden urges concern but not alarm as omicron cases rises On Tuesday, Janet Woodcock, the acting head of the Food and Drug Administration, told Congress that the highly transmissible strain will infect “most people” and that the focus should turn to ensuring critical services can continue uninterrupted. “I think it’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, which is: Most people are going to get COVID, all right?” she said. “What we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function- transportation, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens.” Biden said that he is directing his team to double its procurement of rapid COVID-19 tests to be delivered for free to Americans through a forthcoming federal website, as he seeks to respond to criticism over shortages and long lines for tests. The initial order was for 500 million tests, and now the federal government will purchase 1 billion at-home testing kits. The initial batch of test kits will be available starting next week, Biden said, when the administration launches a new website where Americans can request the free tests. The rest of the tests will be delivered over the coming months. Biden also announced that for the first time his administration was planning to make “high-quality masks,” including N95s, which are most effective at preventing transmission of the virus, available for free. He said his administration would announce details next week. The federal government has a stockpile of more than 750 million N95 masks, the White House said this week. And though research has shown those masks to be better protection, they are often more uncomfortable, and health officials are not altering their guidance to recommend against less-protective cloth masks. The best mask “is the one that you will wear and the one you can keep on all day long, that you can tolerate in public indoor settings,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday. Biden encouraged Americans to wear masks when indoors to slow the spread of the virus, even as he acknowledged they’re a “pain in the neck” “Next week we’ll announce how we’re making high-quality masks available to the American people for free,” he added. During Thursday’s remarks Biden was joined by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who recently recovered from his own case of COVID-19, and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. They were hearing about the work of the more than 800 military personnel who have been helping civilian hospitals since Thanksgiving and the more than 15,000 National Guard members whose work supporting vaccinations, testing and caring for patients is being covered by the federal government. The White House said the they spoke with federal personnel who are already on the ground in Arizona, Michigan and New York to hear about their experiences. Gen. Dan Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said that as of Thursday, there are now 15,200 Guard members around the country supporting COVID-19 missions. State Guard leaders from Ohio, New York and Colorado told reporters on Thursday that they are using only vaccinated troops for missions that directly interact with the public, including at testing sites and in patient care at hospitals. The White House said the teams will support Henry Ford Hospital just outside Detroit, University Hospital in Newark, the University of New Mexico hospital in Albuquerque, Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, Cleveland Clinic and Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. The deployment by the Department of Defense will join another team sent by the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Bob Riney, president of Healthcare Operations and chief operating officer for Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System. He said the phases of the operations would come together “in a highly coordinated way.” “They’re not overlapping. They’re complementary,” he told reporters Thursday. The first team of medical personnel arrived Sunday and went through an orientation before helping patients on Monday. They are providing care for up to 24 beds and supporting staff at Henry Ford Wyandotte with in-patient care and surgeries, Riney said. The first phase is through Jan. 21 and the second team will come for an additional 30 days. “We are looking at 45 days of total support and that has a much more meaningful impact,” he said. “We welcome and are grateful for any support that we have,” said Riney, who told reporters that the federal government chose to address needs at the Wyandotte hospital after the health system submitted its current situation and data to Health and Human Services. A spokesperson for the Cleveland Clinic said the hospital system is “receiving federal support from a team of approximately 20 military medical professionals.” Spokesperson Andrea Pacetti said they likely will begin working next week at the Clinic’s main campus in Cleveland. CEO and President Dr. Tom Mihaljevic in a statement on Thursday said: “We are grateful for the federal support as we continue to face a challenging COVID-19 surge in our Ohio hospitals. The addition of military medical personnel allows us to care for more patients in our community.”  ALSO READ: COVID: Joe Biden revokes southern Africa travel restrictionsPresident Joe Biden on Thursday (January 13) announced that the government will double to 1 billion the rapid, at-home COVID-19 tests to be distributed free to Americans, along with “high-quality masks,” as he highlighted his efforts to “surge” resources to help the country weather the spike in coronavirus cases.Biden also announced that starting next week 1,000 military medical personnel will begin deploying across the country to help overwhelmed medical facilities ease staff shortages due to the highly transmissible omicron variant.

However, the end of coronavirus may not be an end to diseases that add challenges to our daily lives. A new deadly virus - Disease X, is set to hit mankind, and this has been revealed by the doctor who had earlier discovered the outbreak of Ebola. The doctor, Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, had in 1976 helped discover the Ebola and has now said humanity faces an unknown number of new viruses. There are new and potentially fatal viruses emerging from Africa's tropical rainforests, he has said.Professor Muyembe took the first blood samples from the victims of a mysterious disease, later named Ebola when he was a young researcher. The disease caused hemorrhages and killed about 88 per cent of patients and 80 per cent of the staff who were working at the Yambuku Mission Hospital when it was first discovered.The future pandemics could be worse than COVID-19 and could be more apocalyptic, Tamfum has stated. Doctors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have come across a woman, who shows early symptoms of hemorrhagic fever. The patient has already undergone a test for Ebola, however, doctors now fear she is a patient zero of 'Disease X', which stands for unexpected when the results came back negative.According to various reports, Disease X could spread as fast as COVID-19 but has Ebola's 50 to 90 per cent fatality rate.Going by a statement by the World Health Organisation (WHO), 'Disease X' is hypothetical, but scientists fear it could lead to the destruction around the world if and when it occurs."

1291b19e81b59aa221f9e605cfb2cba0,"The possibility of the use of weaponized drones for terrorist activities against strategic and commercial assets calls for serious attention by the global community, India has told the UN General Assembly. India has told the UN General Assembly that it is high time the international community called on Pakistan to take ""effective and irreversible"" actions against terror outfits operating on its soil, asserting that Islamabad should not take the ""high road of morality"" which is only laden with mines of falsehood.Hitting out at Pakistan for its ""vitriolic diatribe"" against India, Special Secretary (Internal Security), Ministry of Home Affairs in the Government of India V S K Kaumudi said: ""as expected, the delegation of Pakistan has again resorted to peddling false narratives and making baseless allegations against India.The possibility of the use of weaponized drones for terrorist activities against strategic and commercial assets calls for serious attention by the global community, India has told the UN General Assembly, a day after two explosives-laden drones crashed into the Indian Air Force (IAF) station at Jammu airport.A fresh attempt to attack a military installation with the help of drones was foiled by alert Army sentries at the Ratnuchak-Kaluchak station who fired at the unmanned aerial vehicles that flew away, an incident that came hours after an IAF station saw the first terror attack using quadcopters.The first drone was spotted at around 11.45 pm on Sunday followed by another at 2.40 am over the military station, which witnessed a terror attack in 2002 in which 31 people were killed, including 10 children. The IAF attack is the first instance of suspected Pakistan-based terrorists deploying drones to strike at the country's vital installations.""Today, misuse of information and communication technology such as internet and social media for terrorist propaganda, radicalisation and recruitment of cadre; misuse of new payment methods and crowdfunding platforms for financing of terrorism; and misuse of emerging technologies for terrorist purposes have emerged as the most serious threats of terrorism and will decide the counter-terrorism paradigm going forward,” Special Secretary (Internal Security), Ministry of Home Affairs in the Government of India, V S K Kaumudi said.Speaking at the ‘Global scourge of terrorism: assessment of current threats and emerging trends for the new decade’, he said, “another add-on” to “existing worries” is the use of drones.""Being a low-cost option and easily available, utilisation of these aerial/sub-surface platforms for sinister purposes by terrorist groups such as intelligence collection, weapon/explosives delivery and targeted attacks have become an imminent danger and challenge for security agencies worldwide,” he said at the 2nd High Level Conference of the Head of Counter-Terrorism Agencies of the Member States in the General Assembly.“The possibility of the use of weaponised drones for terrorist purposes against strategic and commercial assets calls for serious attention by the member states. We have witnessed terrorists using UAS to smuggle weapons across borders,” Kaumudi said, according to his statement issued by the Permanent Mission of India to the UN.Kaumudi said the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent isolation have further accentuated the impact of the internet on people making them vulnerable to radicalisation and recruitment by terrorist groups.Spreading terrorist propaganda through the use of ""indulging video games"" is another strategy that was deployed by terrorist groups during the pandemic, he said.“It is imperative for countries to adopt a multi-pronged approach to tackle the global threats emanating out of misuse of new technologies particularly aiming towards terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism,” he said.India called on the world to remain united against tendencies of labeling terrorism based on terrorist motivations especially those based on religion, and political ideologies.“This will certainly divide us and weaken our fight against terrorism,” Kaumudi said. He said the transborder nature of this threat calls for collective and unified action by the international community, without any excuse or exceptions, ensuring that those countries which provide safe havens to terrorists should be called out and held accountable.India noted with concern that internet and social media platforms have turned into indispensable resources in the toolkit of global terrorist groups for spreading terrorist propaganda and conspiracy theories aimed at spreading hatred among societies and communities and offer additional radicalisation opportunities which may proliferate globally.“The increased use of closed group communications adds to the concern,” he said. Kaumudi told the General Assembly that continuing advancements in evolving technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, robotics, “deep fakes”, blockchain, dark web are fraught with the risk of being abused by terrorists. “Already, cryptocurrencies, virtual assets, crowdfunding platforms are helping terror financing, owing to anonymity and un-traceability of these technologies,” he said.India has put in place an elaborate counter-terrorism and security architecture, besides introducing a series of measures in the cyber-space encapsulating counter-radicalisation and de-radicalisation strategies.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_1453136528 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/06/0_u6qjddlq/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_u6qjddlq_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""After Jammu IAF station attack, two drones seen near military station.

""None of the vaccines at this point appear like they'll work with a single dose. That was the hope at the very beginning,"" he said.Gates, who has been warning about the threat of a global pandemic since 2015, said that deploying a vaccine will require a global effort. ""If what you're trying to do is block all the transmission, then you need to get 70-80% coverage on a global basis. So it is unbelievably big numbers,"" the billionaire philanthropist said. He also said that there will be a lot of uncertainty about the efficacy of any vaccine while also stressing that its a solution ""that will improve over time."" The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated $300 million towards the global effort to beat Covid-19.Over 150 COVID-19 vaccines are currently at different stages of development, with a few advancing to the late-stage clinical trial. In a blog post, Bill Gates had earlier said: ""We need to make billions of doses, we need to get them out to every part of the world, and we need all of this to happen as quickly as possible.""The world will need to manufacture and distribute at least seven billion doses of the vaccine -- or possibly 14 billion if it is a multi-dose vaccine - to beat the pandemic, he had said."

India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was an internal matter and also advised Pakistan to accept the reality.Meanwhile, Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi has sought an end to the rhetoric on Kashmir issue, saying that peaceful dialogue, respect for civil rights and non-violence are the only way forward.“My prayer for the children and people of India and Pakistan is a future of peace,” Krishnamoorthi, the US Representative for Illinois' 8th Congressional district, said in a statement.“In that spirit, heated rhetoric about violence and war over Kashmir should end, and I hope restrictions in Kashmir will be lifted rapidly.

For the Lashkar-I Jhangvi, the amount of funds blocked by the US dropped from USD 12,829 in 2017 to USD 10,962.The report states there was a significant jump in Taliban funds blocked by the United States, which increased from USD 10,728 in 2017 to USD 206,805 in 2018.However, for the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, the US had blocked a paltry USD 318 in 2018.The US continues to block more than USD 500,000 in funds of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has remained the same for the past two years.Notably the al-Qaeda tops the list of the blocked amount, In 2018, the US had blocked USD 6.4 million of the al Qaeda funds, which was nearly USD 900,000 less than the USD 7.3 million blocked in 2017.The OFAC also blocked approximately USD 216.83 million in assets relating to the three designated state sponsors of terrorism in 2018 – Syria, Iran and North Korea."
6fe55024ea4f376b29bf97f23cee1cbb,"President Donald Trump speaks in the Rose Garden of the White House, Friday, Nov. 13, 2020, in Washington.US President Donald Trump on Friday, during his first public remarks since his defeat by President-elect Joe Biden, said a vaccine for COVID-19 would ship in “a matter of weeks” to vulnerable populations, though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet been asked to grant the necessary emergency approvals. Trump's statement on the availability of coronavirus vaccine comes as the United States sets records for confirmed cases of COVID-19 and as hospitalizations near critical levels and fatalities climb to the highest levels since the spring.Meanwhile, public health experts worry that Trump’s refusal to take aggressive action on the pandemic or to coordinate with the Biden team during the final two months of his presidency will only worsen the effects of the virus and hinder the nation’s ability to swiftly distribute a vaccine next year.As states impose new restrictions in the face of rising caseloads, Trump asked all Americans to remain “vigilant.” But he ruled out a nationwide “lockdown” and appeared to acknowledge that the decision won’t be his much longer.“This administration will not be going to a lockdown,” he said. “Hopefully whatever happens in the future, who knows, which administration it will be I guess time will tell, but I can tell you this administration will not go to a lockdown.”Biden, for his part, has not endorsed a nationwide shutdown, but he appealed for Trump to take “urgent action” to curtail the spread of the virus. “The crisis does not respect dates on the calendar, it is accelerating right now,” he said in a statement Friday.Trump said vaccines would “arrive within a few weeks,” saying they were ready and merely awaiting approval — and would be given “to high-risk individuals right away.”In fact, there’s no guarantee that Pfizer’s shot, the front-runner, will get rapid authorization for emergency use. Even if it does, there’s no information yet indicating if the vaccine works in older adults or just younger, healthier adults. Nor does Pfizer have a large commercial stockpile already poised to ship; initial batches of shots would be small and targeted to certain still-to-be-determined populations.(With inputs from AP)"

According to the details, the cases have been filed at the Hajiganj police station. Among the accused are over 3,000 unnamed persons, the police said. In total, as many as 71 cases have so far been filed in different parts of the country in connection with the attacks on Hindus, while nearly 450 people have been arrested for spreading rumours on social media. Attacks on Hindus and their temples have intensified in Bangladesh since last Wednesday after an alleged blasphemous post surfaced on social media during the Durga Puja celebrations.On late Sunday night, a mob damaged 66 houses and set on fire at least 20 homes of Hindus in Bangladesh.The communal attack in Hajiganj upazila of Chandpur on October 13 came despite warnings from the local puja management committee after the violence in Comilla, locals and activists said.Five people died in the clashes after police opened fire, while 33 people were injured. The injured included 23 police officials and staff members, reported Dhaka Tribune.According to the local unit of the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council B'desh violence (BHBCOP), 12 puja mandaps and several Hindu homes were vandalized on October 13 and 14.(With inputs from agencies)Also Read | Delhi: Bangladeshi artist Rokeya Sultana’s exhibition show postponed indefinitely   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_2680292675 = { ""file"": ""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/10/0_ila54lgg/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_ila54lgg_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""Muqabla: Who is propagating hatred towards Hindus in Bangladesh? \n"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""duration"": ""1918"", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_2680292675 = ''; jwsetup_2680292675(); function jwsetup_2680292675() { jwvidplayer_2680292675 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_2680292675"").setup(jwconfig_2680292675); jwvidplayer_2680292675.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_2680292675, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_ila54lgg\"", ns_st_pr=\""Muqabla: Who is propagating hatred towards Hindus in Bangladesh?\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""Muqabla: Who is propagating hatred towards Hindus in Bangladesh?\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""Muqabla: Who is propagating hatred towards Hindus in Bangladesh?\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2021-10-19\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2021-10-19\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://vod-indiatv.akamaized.net/hls/2021/10/0_ila54lgg/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_2680292675.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_2680292675.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_2680292675.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_2680292675.stop(); jwvidplayer_2680292675.remove(); jwvidplayer_2680292675 = ''; jwsetup_2680292675(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_2680292675.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_2680292675.stop(); jwvidplayer_2680292675.remove(); jwvidplayer_2680292675 = ''; jwsetup_2680292675(); return; }); jwvidplayer_2680292675.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_2680292675.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_2680292675.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_2680292675.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_2680292675.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_2680292675.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

a260b94551ddaf0ddd07e91d3fd29ec7,"Citizens of eight countries, including North Korea and Venezuela, will face new restrictions on entry to the U.S. under a proclamation signed by President Donald Trump on Sunday that will replace his expiring travel ban.The new rules, which will impact the citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen, will go into effect on October 18.The restrictions range from an indefinite ban on visas for citizens of countries like Syria to more targeted restrictions. A suspension of non-immigrant visas to citizens for Venezuela, for instance, will apply only to certain government officials and their immediate families.The announcement comes the same day as Trump’s temporary ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries was set to expire 90 days after it went into effect. That ban had barred citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen who lacked a “credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States” from entering the U.S. Only one of those countries, Sudan, will no longer be subject to travel restrictions.“Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet,” Trump tweeted late Sunday after the new policy was announced.Unlike the first iteration of Trump’s travel ban, which sparked chaos at airports across the country and a flurry of legal challenges after being hastily written with little input outside the White House, officials stressed they had been working for months on the new rules, in collaboration with various agencies and in conversation with foreign governments.To limit confusion, valid visas would not be revoked as a result of the proclamation. The order also permits, but does not guarantee, case-by-case waivers for citizens of the affected countries who meet certain criteria.That includes: having previously worked or studied in the U.S. for a lengthy and continuous period of time activity; having previously established “significant contacts” in the U.S.; and having “significant business or professional obligations” in the U.S. Still, officials acknowledged the waiver restrictions were narrower than the exemptions for people with bona fide ties to the United States that the Supreme Court mandated before the expiring order went into effect in late June.The restrictions are targeted at countries that the Department of Homeland Security says fail to share sufficient information with the U.S. or haven’t taken necessary security precautions.DHS has spent recent months working to develop a new security baseline, which includes factors such as whether countries issue electronic passports with biometric information, report lost or stolen passports to INTERPOL, and share information about travelers’ terror-related and criminal histories. The U.S. then shared those benchmarks with every country in the world and gave them 50 days to comply.A total of sixteen countries did not comply with the rules at first, officials said, but half worked with the U.S. to improve their information-sharing and security practices. The remaining eight are now subject to the new restrictions until they make changes to bring them into compliance.The new rules include the suspension of all immigrant visas for nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Yemen and Somalia, and the suspension of non-immigrant visas, such as for business and tourism, to nationals of Chad, Libya, North Korea, Syria and Yemen.Citizens of Iran will not be eligible for tourism and business visas, but remain eligible for student and cultural exchange visas if they undergo additional scrutiny. Such additional scrutiny will also be required for Somali citizens applying for all non-immigrant visas.Trump last week called for a “tougher” travel ban after a bomb partially exploded on a London subway.“The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!” he tweeted.Critics have accused Trump of overstepping his legal authority and violating the U.S. Constitution’s protections against religious bias each time he has ordered new travel restrictions.And the inclusion of Venezuela and North Korea appeared to be an attempt to block challenges from advocacy groups and others who have called the restrictions a ban on Muslims. Trump during his campaign called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”The U.S. had already imposed wide-ranging sanctions on certain high-ranking Venezuelan government officials to protest the government’s attempts to consulate power. The new visa sanctions will apply to all officials from five Venezuelan government security agencies and their immediate families.Johnathan Smith, legal director of the advocacy group Muslim Advocates, slammed the measures in a statement as the “same Muslim ban” and an attempt “to undermine our Constitution.”“Let us not be fooled by the administration’s attempted tricks and semantics, this is still the same Muslim ban,” he said. “The administration is once again making cosmetic adjustments to the Muslim ban in hopes that it will pass the barest possible definition of anything else; but they’ve failed again.”But administration officials argue the measure is necessary to keep Americans safe.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement the president was carrying out his duty to protect the American people. He said the State Department would coordinate with other federal agencies to implement the measures in “an orderly manner” and would “continue to work closely with our allies and partners who share our commitment to national and global security.”The new policy could also complicate the Supreme Court’s upcoming review of the order, which is scheduled for argument next month.The Justice Department has suggested to the Supreme Court that the two sides submit new legal briefs by October 5 — five days before the argument — that address how the new policy will affect the case.(With AP inputs)"

ee177a70b6f53e4b1517ae14e0cfe867,"Representational ImageNearly 740,000 access deaths in India annually can be attributed to abnormal hot and cold temperatures related to climate change, according to a study published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal.An international team, led by researchers at Monash University in Australia, found that globally more than five million extra deaths a year can be attributed to non-optimal temperatures.The study published on Wednesday found that deaths related to hot temperatures increased in all regions from 2000 to 2019, indicating that global warming due to climate change will make this mortality figure worse in the future.In India, the number of deaths per year linked with abnormal cold temperatures is 655,400, while as the number of deaths associated with high temperatures is 83,700, according to the researchers.The team looked at mortality and temperature data across the world from 2000 to 2019, a period when global temperatures rose by 0. 26 degrees Celsius per decade.The study, the first to definitively link non-optimal temperatures to annual increases in mortality, found 9.43 per cent of global deaths could be attributed to cold and hot temperatures.This equates to 74 excess deaths for every 100,000 people, with most deaths caused by cold exposure.Global warming may ""slightly reduce the number of temperature-related deaths, largely because of the lessening in cold-related mortality,"" said Professor Yuming Guo, from the Monash University.""However in the long-term climate change is expected to increase the mortality burden because heat-related mortality would be continuing to increase,"" Guo said.The data shows geographic differences in the impact of non-optimal temperatures on mortality, with Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa having the highest heat and cold-related excess death rates.Cold-related death decreased 0.51 per cent from 2000 to 2019, while heat-related death increased 0.21 per cent, leading to a reduction in net mortality due to cold and hot temperatures.Of the global deaths attributed to abnormal cold and heat, the study found more than half occurred in Asia, particularly in East and South Asia.Europe had the highest excess death rates per 100,000 due to heat exposure, according to the researchers.Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest death rates per 100,000 due to exposure to cold, they said.The largest decline of net mortality occurred in Southeast Asia while there was temporal increase in South Asia and Europe.Previous studies had looked at temperature-related mortality within a single country or region.""This is the first study to get a global overview of mortality due to non-optimal temperature conditions between 2000 and 2019, the hottest period since the Pre-Industrial era,"" Guo said.The researchers used data from 43 countries across five continents with different climates, socioeconomic and demographic conditions and differing levels of infrastructure and public health services.""The study had a large and varied sample size, unlike previous studies,"" Guo added.The mortality data from this study is significantly higher than the second-largest study published in 2015, conducted across 13 countries/regions, which estimated 7.7 per cent of deaths were related to cold and hot temperatures.""The importance of taking data from all points of the globe was to get a more accurate understanding of the real impact of non-optimal temperatures under climate change,"" Guo said.Understanding the geographic patterns of temperature-related mortality is important for the international collaboration in developing policies and strategies in climate change mitigation and adaptation and health protection, he added.READ MORE: Monsoon likely to reach Delhi around July 10; most-delayed in 15 yrs: IMD"

b11b67ac97cc54224148c94de0f0cc97,"Jack Ma, founder of China’s e-commerce giant AlibabaJack Ma, founder of China’s e-commerce giant Alibaba suffered a major setback on Tuesday as Shanghai and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges suspended dual listing of the shares of his world's biggest initial public offer of USD 39.7 billion of the group's subsidiary - the Ant Group, 48 hours before the highly-anticipated trading was due to start.The Shanghai Stock Exchange surprised market investors with an abrupt announcement late on Tuesday that it will suspend Ant Group's IPO, as regulators and the public debate the balance between financial innovation and risk control, state-run Global Times reported.According to media reports, the Hong Kong exchange followed suit several minutes later.Ant Group is reportedly being asked to clarify on its business model, financial innovations, measures to protect users' private data the platform has collected, and other issues. It is also possible that the fintech venture could be asked to restructure its business, the daily’s report said.There were signs of trouble on Monday for Ma, 56, China's iconic businessman when he was summoned along with his senior executives by Chinese regulators, which was seen as a firm sign by the officials of the ruling Communist Party of China, (CPC) to contain his new record venture.Ant Group's shares were due to commence trading simultaneously in Shanghai and Hong Kong on November 5 in a USD 39.67 billion stock sale after allotment, which has broken all records as the largest fundraising in global finance.The first dual listing of its kind on the two exchanges soaked up more than USD three trillion from retail investors, setting off frenzied bids for the shares of Ant Group, according to Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, which is owned by Ma, reported on Monday.A record 19.05 trillion yuan (USD 2.85 trillion) of bids were received from retail investors for Ant's shares on Shanghai's Star Market, exceeding the supply of shares by 870 times.In Hong Kong, 1.55 million retail investors, or about one-fifth of the city's population, poured in HKD 1.3 trillion (USD 167.7 billion) for the shares when the book closed at noon on Friday, overbidding by 389 times, the report said.Last year's sudden and surprise announcement by Ma to retire stating that he preferred to die at a beach than at his work table set off speculation that he was feeling the weight of the CPC, which firmly exercised its control over China's top businesses prompting him to downsize his business.Born in a poor family, Jack Ma, who is the most revered businessman among the Chinese, grew up to be one of China's richest men.His newspaper The Post on Tuesday reported that China's stock market operator has pulled the rug from under the largest initial public offering in global finance, less than 48 hours before the highly-anticipated trading was due to start.A meeting earlier this week between Ant Group's senior executives and China's top financial regulators constituted “significant change” in the regulatory environment, which may lead to the fintech company not fulfilling the listing requirements or disclosure rules of the exchange, it said citing a statement by the Shanghai bourse operator.Ma, the co-founder of Alibaba, owns 8 percent of Ant Group's shares, with 50 percent of the voting rights.The government concerns reportedly arose as the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), China's 2.63 trillion yuan pension state pension scheme has been a strategic investor in Ant Group since 2015 and remains a cornerstone investor in the fintech company. "

The image shows the alleged attacker standing with the explosive belt in front of the black IS flag with a black cloth covering his face, only his eyes showing.The statement made no mention of a second suicide bomber or gunmen. The claim could not be independently verified.IS also said the bomber managed to get past Taliban security checkpoints to come within 5 metres (yards) of a gathering of US soldiers, translators and collaborators before detonating his explosives. It said Taliban were also among the casualties. The extremist IS group has battled the Taliban, which it views as traitorous for agreeing to a peace deal with the United States.The statement also said the bomber got around US security measures and that the camp that was targeted was where US forces were gathering paperwork for those who’ve worked with the military.ALSO READ: ​Afghanistan LIVE: 60 Afghans, 13 US troops killed in ISIS attack outside Kabul airport "
3583b4222f2765326000ccb8f6ef2302,"Boris Johnson to lay out ‘cautious’ roadmap for easing UK lockdownUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to table a “cautious” roadmap in Parliament on Monday to ease the country out of the strict stay-at-home lockdown in place to control the spread of coronavirus infections. The strategy, to be finalised at a virtual Cabinet meeting, will set out the latest data on infection rates, hospitalisations and deaths, as well as early data showing the efficacy of vaccines.Based on the latest Covid-19 statistics, Johnson is expected to confirm that all schools will reopen across England from March 8 and that families and friends can begin to be reunited outdoors under a return of the “rule of six” for gatherings later in March.Members of Parliament will vote on the regulations, following which the final roadmap will kick into action in the coming weeks.“Today I’ll be setting out a roadmap to bring us out of lockdown cautiously. Our priority has always been getting children back into school which we know is crucial for their education as well as their mental and physical wellbeing, and we will also be prioritising ways for people to reunite with loved ones safely,” said Johnson, ahead of his statement in the House of Commons.“Our decisions will be made on the latest data at every step, and we will be cautious about this approach so that we do not undo the progress we have achieved so far and the sacrifices each and every one of you has made to keep yourself and others safe. We have therefore set four key tests which must be met before we can move through each step of the plan,” he said.The key tests cover four aspects: the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully; evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated; infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations, which would put unsustainable pressure on the National Health Service (NHS); and the assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new ""variants of concern”.Before proceeding to the next step, the government said it will examine the data to assess the impact of previous easements.Due to the current relatively uniform spread of the virus across the country, restrictions will be eased step-by-step across the whole of England at the same time.Downing Street said that the four tests are currently being met so the first step will proceed from March 8, at which point the top four priority cohorts for vaccinations – as determined by the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) – will have received a degree of immunity, three weeks after being offered their first dose.The roadmap is described as a means to balance social and economic impacts, whilst preserving health and safety. Outdoor settings are known to be lower risk than indoor in keeping infection rates low, so outdoor activities will be opened earlier than indoor ones.The devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been setting out their own roadmaps for easing lockdown, but are in most part following a similar phased approach.As part of the new roadmap, Public Health England (PHE) will publish new data on the impact of vaccines on transmission rates.Early data suggests a reduction in transmission of the virus in people who have had a vaccine.So far, more than 17.5 million people in the UK have received a vaccine dose and over the weekend the government set a new July 31 target to ensure all adults have received their jabs to protect against the deadly virus."

3b76b9167d5ffe18e638d5bd458f8878,"US court dismisses H1B visa denials under Trump administration A US court has dissolved crucial memos of Trump administration and decisions behind rising denial of H-1B visas. This decision comes as a relief to IT services companies that use foreign workers, a large number of whom are from India. They have faced intense pushback and pressure in recent years.These memos had sent up the rate of denial of H-1Bs from 2% in 2015 to 30% for some companies, according to an analysis of government data by an independent body.According to media reports, the court of a district judge in Washington DC on Tuesday struck down memos used by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to prevent companies from hiring foreign workers on H-1B visas for third-party work — outsourced operations in other words, and required employers to produce contract details for which the H-1B had been petitioned. The court also directed the agency to provide reasons while rejecting an H-1B petition.“A decision like this has been long overdue, we finally have the judicial system agreeing with the employers that USCIS has been out of bounds for a long time,” said Amar Varada, president of ITServe, an association of more than 1,200 IT solutions and services organization, whose challenge led to the Tuesday ruling.The United States issues 85,000 H-1B visas annually to highly skilled foreign workers on petitions from US companies to make up for a shortage of locally available hands. Critics of the programme have argued it has been used to displace American workers by contracting out their work to foreigners.Denial of initial applications for H-1B visas and renewal applications has gone up under the Trump administration’s “Buy American, Hire American” policy. The National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), an independent body that closely tracks immigration issues, denial rates have generally risen from 6% in 2015 to 21% in 2019 for new petitions; and from 3% to 12% for continuing employment, renewals in other words.The agency also found that the denial rate for new employment had gone up to 30% in 2019 for IT services and consulting companies in comparison to between 2% and 7% for technology product companies such as Apple.“The (new) ruling applies to all companies. However, its largest impact will be felt by companies that need to send an H-1B visa holder to a customer’s site, because it was in those cases that new USCIS policies were being used to either deny an H-1B petition or approve it for only a short period of time,” said Stuart Anderson, executive director of NFAP.(With inputs from agencies)"

The implementation of the FATF recommendations, besides taking action against terrorist networks, would help the US revise its travel advisory against Pakistan, the diplomat said in response to a question.""We want to see improvements in Pakistan's security situation so that we can reflect that in a travel advisory,"" Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice Well said at an event at the Wilson Center think tank on Thursday. ""Some of the steps that, I think, are very important are Pakistan's implementation, full implementation of the Financial Action Task Force requirement to counter-terrorism financing, to prosecute and seize the assets of members of terrorist organisations,"" Wells said.In its last travel advisory issued on April 9 this year, the US State Department urged American citizens to reconsider their travel to Pakistan. It also advised US citizens against travelling to Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in view of terrorism and kidnapping. The travel advisory is revised every six months.Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Pakistan, said the advisory.

We, the Leaders of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Russian Federation, the Republic of India, the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa, met on 4 September 2017 in Xiamen, China, at the Ninth BRICS Summit. Under the theme “BRICS: Stronger Partnership for a Brighter Future”, we endeavor to build on our achievements already made with a shared vision for future development of BRICS. We also discussed international and regional issues of common concern and adopted the Xiamen Declaration by consensus.2. We reiterate that it is the overarching objective and our desire for peace, security, development and cooperation that brought us together 10 years ago. BRICS countries have since traversed a remarkable journey together on their respective development paths tailored to their national circumstances, devoted to growing their economies and improving people’s livelihoods. Our committed and concerted efforts have generated a momentum of all-dimensional and multi-layered cooperation fostered by the previous Leaders’ Summits. Upholding development and multilateralism, we are working together for a more just, equitable, fair, democratic and representative international political and economic order.3. Our cooperation since 2006 has fostered the BRICS spirit featuring mutual respect and understanding, equality, solidarity, openness, inclusiveness and mutually beneficial cooperation, which is our valuable asset and an inexhaustible source of strength for BRICS cooperation. We have shown respect for the development paths of our respective choices, and rendered understanding and support to each other’s interests. We have upheld equality and solidarity. We have also embraced openness and inclusiveness, dedicated to forging an open world economy. We have furthered our cooperation with emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs). We have worked together for mutually beneficial outcomes and common development, constantly deepening BRICS practical cooperation which benefits the world at large.4. We draw satisfaction from the many fruitful results of our cooperation, including establishing the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), formulating the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership, strengthening political and security cooperation including through Meetings of BRICS High Representatives for Security Issues and Foreign Ministers Meetings, and deepening the traditional ties of friendship amongst our peoples.5. Recalling our Summits in Ufa and Goa, we will work together to further enhance BRICS strategic partnership for the welfare of our peoples. We commit ourselves to build upon the outcomes and consensus of our previous Summits with unwavering conviction, so as to usher in the second golden decade of BRICS cooperation and solidarity.6. Believing in the broad development prospects of our countries and the vast potential of our cooperation, we have full confidence in the future of BRICS. We commit to further strengthen our cooperation.- We will energize our practical cooperation to boost development of BRICS countries. We will, inter alia, promote exchanges of good practices and experiences on development, and facilitate market inter-linkages as well as infrastructure and financial integration to achieve interconnected development. We shall also strive towards broad partnerships with EMDCs, and in this context, we will pursue equal-footed and flexible practices and initiatives for dialogue and cooperation with non-BRICS countries, including through BRICS Plus cooperation.- We will enhance communication and coordination in improving global economic governance to foster a more just and equitable international economic order. We will work towards enhancement of the voice and representation of BRICS countries and EMDCs in global economic governance and promote an open, inclusive and balanced economic globalization, thus contributing towards development of EMDCs and providing strong impetus to redressing North-South development imbalances and promoting global growth.- We will emphasize fairness and justice to safeguard international and regional peace and stability. We will stand firm in upholding a fair and equitable international order based on the central role of the United Nations, the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and respect for international law, promoting democracy and the rule of law in international relations, and making joint efforts to address common traditional and non-traditional security challenges, so as to build a brighter shared future for the global community.- We will embrace cultural diversity and promote people-to-people exchanges to garner more popular support for BRICS cooperation through deepened traditional friendships.

We note that against the backdrop of more solid global economic growth, enhanced resilience and emerging new drivers, BRICS countries continue to play an important role as engines of global growth. Noting the uncertainties and downside risks that persist, we emphasize the need to be vigilant in guarding against inward-looking policies and tendencies that are weighing on global growth prospects and market confidence. We call upon all countries to calibrate and communicate their macroeconomic and structural policies and strengthen policy coordination.8. We note that practical economic cooperation has traditionally served as a foundation of BRICS cooperation, notably through implementing the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership and initiatives related to its priority areas such as trade and investment, manufacturing and minerals processing, infrastructure connectivity, financial integration, science, technology and innovation, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) cooperation, among others. We welcome the first report on the implementation of the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership, and the broad package of outcomes delivered by the sectoral ministerial meetings. We commit to use all policy tools - fiscal, monetary and structural - and adopt innovation-driven development strategies to enhance resilience and potentials of our economies, so as to contribute to strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive global growth.9. Stressing the role of enhanced trade and investment cooperation in unleashing the potential of BRICS economies, we agree to improve and broaden trade and investment cooperation mechanism and scope, with a view to enhancing BRICS economic complementarity and diversification in BRICS countries. We welcome the positive outcomes of the 7th BRICS Trade Ministers Meeting in terms of the cooperative frameworks, roadmaps and outlines on trade and investment facilitation and connectivity and enhanced policy sharing, information exchange, capacity building, through enhanced joint efforts on trade and investment facilitation, trade in services, E-commerce, IPR (in synergy with the cooperation activities among BRICS IP authorities), economic and technical cooperation, SMEs and women economic empowerment.

We encourage the BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism to continue playing an important role in supporting BRICS economic and trade cooperation. We commend the progress in concluding the Memoranda of Understanding among national development banks of BRICS countries on interbank local currency credit line and on interbank cooperation in relation to credit rating.12.

We welcome the setting up of the Project Preparation Fund and the approval of the 2nd batch of projects. We congratulate the Bank on the ground-breaking of its permanent headquarters building. We stress the significance of infrastructure connectivity to foster closer economic ties and partnerships among countries. We encourage the NDB to fully leverage its role and enhance cooperation with multilateral development institutions including the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as well as with the BRICS Business Council, to forge synergy in mobilizing resources and promote infrastructure construction and sustainable development of BRICS countries.32. We emphasize the importance of an open and inclusive world economy enabling all countries and peoples to share in the benefits of globalization. We remain firmly committed to a rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system as embodied in the WTO. We reaffirm our commitments to ensure full implementation and enforcement of existing WTO rules and are determined to work together to further strengthen the WTO. We call for the acceleration of the implementation of the Bali and Nairobi MCM outcomes and for the WTO ministerial conference to be held this year in Argentina to produce positive outcomes. We will continue to firmly oppose protectionism. We recommit to our existing pledge for both standstill and rollback of protectionist measures and we call upon other countries to join us in that commitment.33. Valuing the G20’s continued role as the premier forum for international economic cooperation, we reiterate our commitments to the implementation of the outcomes of G20 summits, including the Hamburg Summit and the Hangzhou Summit. We call upon the G20 to further enhance macroeconomic policy coordination to minimize negative spillovers and external shocks to EMDEs. We agree to enhance coordination and cooperation under the Argentina Presidency in 2018, with an aim to make the G20 process and outcomes reflect the interests and priorities of EMDEs.34. We reaffirm our commitment to achieving a fair and modern global tax system and promoting a more equitable, pro-growth and efficient international tax environment, including to deepening cooperation on addressing Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), promoting exchange of tax information and improving capacity-building in developing countries. We will strengthen BRICS tax cooperation to increase BRICS contribution to setting international tax rules and provide, according to each country’s priorities, effective and sustainable technical assistance to other developing countries. International Peace and Security35. Cognizant of the profound changes the world is undergoing and the global security challenges and threats faced by the international community, we commit to enhance communication and cooperation in international fora on issues concerning international peace and security. We reiterate our commitment to safeguarding world peace and security and to upholding the basic norms of the international law, and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations including sovereign equality and non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs.36. We welcome the 7th Meeting of the BRICS High Representatives for Security Issues held on 27-28 July 2017 in Beijing, and commend the meeting for having discussion and deepening our common understanding on global governance, counter-terrorism, security in the use of ICTs, energy security, major international and regional hotspots as well as national security and development. We note Brazil’s proposal to establish a BRICS Intelligence Forum. We welcome Chair’s report to us on the proceedings of the Meeting and encourage the succeeding chairpersonships to continue this exercise. We look forward to enhancing practical security cooperation agreed upon in the above areas.37. We welcome China’s hosting of the Meeting of BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations in Beijing on 18-19 June 2017 at the initiative of China. Ministers exchanged views on major global political, security, economic and financial issues of common concern and on strengthening BRICS cooperation. We look forward to the upcoming meeting of Foreign Ministers on the margins of the UNGA. We welcome South Africa’s offer to host the next stand-alone Foreign Ministers Meeting in 2018.38. We recall that development and security are closely interlinked, mutually reinforcing and key to attaining sustainable peace. We reiterate our view that the establishment of sustainable peace requires a comprehensive, concerted and determined approach, based on mutual trust, mutual benefit, equity and cooperation, that addresses the causes of conflicts, including their political, economic and social dimensions. We condemn unilateral military interventions, economic sanctions and arbitrary use of unilateral coercive measures in violation of international law and universally recognized norms of international relations. We emphasize that no country should enhance its security at the expense of the security of others.39. We reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations as the universal multilateral organization entrusted with the mandate for maintaining international peace and security, advance global development and to promote and protect human rights.40. We recall the 2005 World Summit Outcome document and reaffirm the need for a comprehensive reform of the UN, including its Security Council, with a view to making it more representative, effective and efficient, and to increase the representation of the developing countries so that it can adequately respond to global challenges. China and Russia reiterate the importance they attach to the status and role of Brazil, India and South Africa in international affairs and support their aspiration to play a greater role in the UN.41. We reiterate that the only lasting solution to the crisis in Syria is through an inclusive “Syrian-led, Syrian-owned” political process which safeguards the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria, in pursuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254(2015), and promotes the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people. We strongly support the Geneva Peace Talks and the Astana process, and welcome the creation of the de-escalation areas in Syria, which contributed to decrease the levels of violence and generate positive momentum and conditions for meaningful progress in the peace talks under the auspices of the UN. We oppose the use of chemical weapons by anyone, for any purpose and under any circumstance.42. We reiterate the urgent need for a just, lasting and comprehensive solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in order to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid Principles, the Arab Peace Initiative and previous agreements between the parties through negotiations with a view to creating an independent, viable, territorially contiguous Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel. Committed to making greater contribution to such solution, we express readiness to enhance our contribution towards a just and lasting resolution of the Middle East conflict and support international efforts to promote peace and stability in the region.43. We congratulate the people and Government of Iraq for the recovery of Mosul and for the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism and reaffirm our commitment to Iraq’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence and our support for Iraqi government and its people. We express our concern over the situation in Yemen and urge all parties to cease hostilities and to resume negotiations supported by the United Nations. We also call on all parties directly involved in the current diplomatic crisis in the Gulf region to overcome their dissensions through dialogue and welcome the efforts of Kuwaiti mediation in this regard.44. We strongly deplore the nuclear test conducted by the DPRK. We express deep concern over the ongoing tension and prolonged nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, and emphasize that it should only be settled through peaceful means and direct dialogue of all the parties concerned.45. We firmly support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the Iranian nuclear issue and call upon all relevant parties to comply fully with their obligations and ensure full and effective implementation of the JCPOA to promote international and regional peace and stability. 46. We commend the efforts of African countries, the African Union and sub-regional organizations in addressing regional issues and maintaining regional peace and security, and emphasize the importance of collaboration between the United Nations and the African Union in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. We support efforts towards comprehensively resolving the issues in Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya, South Sudan, Somalia, Central Africa Republic and Western Sahara.47. We strongly condemn terrorist attacks resulting in death to innocent Afghan nationals. There is a need for immediate cessation of violence. We reaffirm our support to the people of Afghanistan in their efforts to achieve “Afghan-led and Afghan-owned” peace and national reconciliation, to the ongoing international efforts, including the Moscow Format of consultations on Afghanistan and “Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process”, as well as multimodal connectivity projects to promote peace and stability, to the fight against terrorism and drug-threat, and to the national reconstruction efforts by Afghanistan. We support the efforts of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces in fighting terrorist organizations.48. We, in this regard, express concern on the security situation in the region and violence caused by the Taliban, ISIL/DAISH, Al-Qaida and its affiliates including Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Haqqani network, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, TTP and Hizb ut-Tahrir.49. We deplore all terrorist attacks worldwide, including attacks in BRICS countries, and condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations wherever committed and by whomsoever and stress that there can be no justification whatsoever for any act of terrorism. We reaffirm that those responsible for committing, organizing, or supporting terrorist acts must be held accountable. Recalling the primary leading role and responsibility of states in preventing and countering terrorism, we stress the necessity to develop international cooperation, in accordance with the principles of international law, including that of sovereign equality of states and non-interference in their internal affairs. We reaffirm solidarity and resolve in the fight against terrorism, value the 2nd BRICS Counter-Terrorism Working Group Meeting held in Beijing on 18 May 2017, and agree to strengthen our cooperation.50. We call upon all nations to adopt a comprehensive approach in combating terrorism, which should include countering radicalization, recruitment, movement of terrorists including Foreign Terrorist Fighters, blocking sources of financing terrorism including, for instance, through organized crime by means of money-laundering, supply of weapons, drug trafficking and other criminal activities, dismantling terrorist bases, and countering misuse of the Internet including social media by terrorist entities through misuse of the latest Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). We are committed to prevent and counter the growing spread of terrorist narratives, and to tackle all sources, techniques and channels of terrorist financing. We call for swift and effective implementation of relevant UNSC Resolutions and the FATF International Standards worldwide. We seek to intensify our cooperation in FATF and FATF-style regional bodies (FSRBs). We recall the responsibility of all States to prevent financing of terrorist networks and terrorist actions from their territories.51. We call upon the international community to establish a genuinely broad international counter-terrorism coalition and support the UN’s central coordinating role in this regard. We stress that the fight against terrorism must be conducted in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, international refugee and humanitarian law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We reaffirm our commitment on increasing the effectiveness of the UN counter-terrorism framework, including in the areas of cooperation and coordination among the relevant UN entities, designation of terrorists and terrorist groups and technical assistance to Members States. We call for expeditious finalization and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) by the United Nations General Assembly.52. We recognize the important contribution of BRICS countries to United Nations peacekeeping operations, and the importance of United Nations peacekeeping operations to international peace and security. We emphasize the need for BRICS countries to further enhance communication on peacekeeping matters.53. We reiterate our commitment to address the world drug problem based on the United Nations drug control conventions, through an integrated, comprehensive and balanced approach to drug supply and demand reduction strategies. We stress the importance of the outcome document of the 30th Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on the world drug problem, and call for strengthening of international and regional cooperation and coordination to counter the global threat caused by the illicit production and trafficking of drugs, especially opiates. We note with deep concern the increasing links in some regions of the world between drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime and terrorism.54. We reiterate the need for all countries to cooperate in promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms under the principles of equality and mutual respect. We agree to continue to treat all human rights, including the right to development, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis. We will strengthen cooperation on issues of common interests both within BRICS and in multilateral fora including the United Nations Human Rights Council, taking into account the necessity to promote, protect and fulfill human rights in a non-selective, non-politicized and constructive manner, and without double standards.55. Keenly aware of the global security challenges faced by the international community in the area of international migration, we emphasize the growing role of effective migration regulation for the benefit of international security and development of the society.56. We consider the UN has a central role in developing universally accepted norms of responsible state behavior in the use of ICTs to ensure a peaceful, secure, open, cooperative, stable, orderly, accessible and equitable ICT environment. We emphasize the paramount importance of the principles of international law enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, particularly the state sovereignty, the political independence, territorial integrity and sovereign equality of states, non-interference in internal affairs of other states and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We emphasize the need to enhance international cooperation against terrorist and criminal misuse of ICTs, reaffirm the general approach laid in the eThekwini, Fortaleza, Ufa and Goa declarations in this regard, and recognize the need for a universal regulatory binding instrument on combatting the criminal use of ICTs under the UN auspices as stated in the Ufa Declaration. We note with satisfaction the progress achieved by the Working Group of Experts of the BRICS States on Security in the use of ICTs. We decide to promote cooperation according to the BRICS Roadmap of Practical Cooperation on Ensuring Security in the Use of ICTs or any other mutually agreed mechanism and acknowledge the initiative of the Russian Federation on a BRICS intergovernmental agreement on cooperation in ensuring security in the use of ICTs.57. We believe that all states should participate on an equal footing in the evolution and functioning of the Internet and its governance, bearing in mind the need to involve relevant stakeholders in their respective roles and responsibilities. The structures that manage and regulate the critical Internet resources need to be made more representative and inclusive. We note with satisfaction the progress made by the BRICS Working Group on ICT Cooperation. We recognize the necessity to strengthen our cooperation in this area. To that end, BRICS will continue to work together through the existing mechanism to contribute to the secure, open, peaceful and cooperative use of ICTs on the basis of equal participation of the international community in its management.58. We reiterate that outer space shall be free for peaceful exploration and used by all States on the basis of equality in accordance with international law. Reaffirming that outer space shall remain free from any kind of weapons or any use of force, we stress that negotiations for the conclusion of an international agreement or agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space are a priority task of the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, and support the efforts to start substantive work, inter alia, based on the updated draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects submitted by China and the Russian Federation. We also note an international initiative for a political obligation on the no first placement of weapons in outer space.59. Priority should be accorded to ensuring the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, as well as ways and means of preserving outer space for future generations. We note that this is an important objective on the current agenda of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS). In this respect, we welcome the decision by the UNCOPUOS Scientific and Technical Sub-Committee Working Group on Long-term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities to conclude negotiations and achieve consensus on the full set of guidelines for the long term sustainability of outer space activities by 2018 to coincide with the commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the first United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE + 50). People-to-People Exchanges60. We emphasize the importance of people-to-people exchanges to promoting development and enhancing mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation among BRICS peoples. We agree to deepen cooperation in such fields as culture, education, science and technology, sports and health as well as among media organizations and local governments, to strengthen the third pillar of BRICS cooperation and foster a meaningful resonance of the BRICS partnership amongst its peoples.61. We value cultural diversity as a precious asset of BRICS cooperation. We stress the role of culture and cultural diversity in promoting sustainable development, and encourage BRICS countries to engage in cultural exchanges and mutual learning to cultivate common values on the basis of diversity and sharing. We welcome the formulation of a BRICS action plan to advance practical cultural cooperation and the establishment of the BRICS Alliance of Libraries, Alliance of Museums, Alliance of Art Museums and National Galleries as well as Alliance of Theaters for Children and Young People. We look forward to the success of the BRICS Culture Festival to be held later in mid-September 2017 in Xiamen. We will continue our work on the establishment of a BRICS Cultural Council to provide the necessary platform to enhance cultural cooperation among BRICS countries.62. We stress the importance of education to promoting sustainable economic and social development, and to strengthening BRICS partnership, and commend the positive progress in our education cooperation. We reiterate our support for BRICS University League and BRICS Network University in conducting education and research cooperation, welcome efforts to promote cooperation among educational think tanks, and exchanges among youth including by organizing youth summer camps and offering more scholarship opportunities to BRICS students. We agree to share experience and practices in realizing education-related sustainable development goals. 63. We believe in the importance of sports cooperation to popularizing traditional sports and deepening the friendship among BRICS peoples. Recalling the successful hosting of BRICS U-17 Football Tournament in Goa in 2016, we commend the success of the First BRICS Games, which was a highlight of this year’s people-to-people exchanges. We encourage relevant departments to sign an MOU on sports cooperation to provide greater impetus to sports cooperation among our five countries.64. We agree to enhance BRICS role in global health governance, especially in the context of the World Health Organization and UN agencies, and foster the development and improve the availability of innovative medical products through promotion of research and development and access to affordable, quality, effective and safe drugs, vaccines, diagnostics and other medical products and technologies as well as to medical services through enhanced health systems and health financing. We agree to improve surveillance capacity and medical services to combat infectious diseases, including Ebola, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as non-communicable diseases and encourage greater application of ICTs to improve the level of health service provision. We welcome the outcomes of the BRICS Health Ministers Meeting and High-level Meeting on Traditional Medicine, and commend the establishment of a long-term mechanism for traditional medicine exchanges and cooperation, to promote mutual learning of traditional medicines and pass them down to future generations. We welcome the decision to set up the Tuberculosis Research Network, to be presented at the First WHO Global Ministerial Conference Ending Tuberculosis in the Sustainable Development Era: A Multisectoral Response, Moscow, Russian Federation, 16-17 November 2017. We express support for the meeting as well as the First United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on Tuberculosis in 2018. We commit ourselves to enhanced cooperation at international fora on health matters including at G20.65. We reaffirm our commitment to promote a long-term and balanced demographic development and continue cooperation on population related matters in accordance with the Agenda for BRICS Cooperation on Population Matters for 2015-2020.66. We note with satisfaction the progress in the exchanges and cooperation in various areas, including governance, film-making, media, think-tank, youth, parliament, local governments and trade union, and agree to further advance such exchanges and cooperation. We commend the first joint film production by BRICS countries and commend the success of the BRICS Film Festival, the Media Forum, Friendship Cities and Local Governments Cooperation Forum, Youth Forum, Young Diplomats Forum and Young Scientists Forum. We appreciate the successful hosting of the BRICS Forum of Political Parties, Think-Tanks and Civil Society Organizations as well as the Seminar on Governance, and will carry these good initiatives forward in the future. In this regard, we note the proposal to establish by China the BRICS Research and Exchange Fund.67. We appreciate the important progress in BRICS institutional development and reiterate our commitment to further strengthen it to make BRICS cooperation more responsive to the changing situation. We commend China for taking measures during its Chairmanship to enhance the Sherpas’ coordination role in BRICS cooperation. We instruct the Sherpas to continue their discussion concerning BRICS institutional development.68. We recommit our strong support for multilateralism and the central role of the UN in international affairs. We commit to strengthening the coordination and cooperation among BRICS in the areas of mutual and common interests within the UN and other multilateral institutions, including through regular meetings among our permanent representatives in New York, Geneva and Vienna, and further enhance the voice of BRICS in international fora.69. In continuation of BRICS tradition of outreach since the Durban Summit, we will hold a Dialogue of Emerging Market and Developing Countries on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the building of broad partnerships for development under the theme of “Strengthening Mutually-Beneficial Cooperation for Common Development” in promotion of BRICS Plus cooperation.70. South Africa, Brazil, Russia and India commend China’s Chairmanship in 2017 and express sincere gratitude to the Government and people of China for hosting the Ninth BRICS Summit in Xiamen.71.

The United States will continue promoting a stable, prosperous, and democratic transition in Burma,"" Sanders said.Welcoming their release Senator Marco Rubio said the two journalists were unjustly jailed for their work -- reporting the alleged atrocities against the Rohingya.""Their cases serve as a reminder of the critical role a free press plays in bringing accountability and transparency to governments, and we must do all we can to protect and advance those principles,"" Rubio said.Non-profit Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also welcomed the release.""As well as the release of two individuals who should never have been in prison – Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo – this is a fundamental victory for press freedom and for the RSF, which had campaigned constantly since their arrest,"" said Daniel Bastard, the head of RSF's Asia-Pacific desk.""Their case is emblematic of investigative journalism's importance for the functioning of democracies. We hail the role played by all those civil society actors who, both in Myanmar and internationally, never forgot the fate of these two journalists and kept fighting for them until this successful outcome,"" he said.Also Read | Jailed Reuters journalists freed in Myanmar"

He calling Basit’s letter ""disgusting"".Basit ""wrongly thinks that he could not reach the post of foreign secretary because of me ? he has since retired,"" Chaudhry said in his response which was emailed to journalists.""I have served my country to the best of my abilities. Some of us like Basit fail to realise that life is a combination of human endeavour and fate. We have to accept in humility what life gives us and then thank the Creator for that,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Jealousy has no remedy,"" he added.In his letter, Basit had slammed Chaudhry as the ""worst foreign secretary ever"" and blamed him for several foreign policy disasters including the Ufa joint statement with India.Chaudhry further said that after the letter became public, many colleagues expressed their support and friendship to him. ""Now that the letter is on social media, I thought I should share with you my sense of disappointment at being targeted like that,"" he said.Basit, who was twice overlooked for the post of foreign secretary, made the harsh remarks in the letter dated July 5, 2017 and printed on his official letterhead while he still served as Pakistan’s high commissioner in New Delhi.""The more I think the more I am convinced that you have been the worst Foreign Secretary ever,"" Basit wrote in response to a farewell letter by Chaudhry which he sent to Basit on March 12 after his appointment as the ambassador of Pakistan to Washington.Instead of wishing him good luck on his new assignment, Basit had an ominous warning in the letter: ""My concern is that you would also end up being the worst Pakistan Ambassador in Washington D.C.""Basit opted for an early retirement earlier this month and was replaced by Sohail Mahmood as the high commissioner. It is pertinent to mention that Chaudhry was appointed as the foreign secretary by ignoring Basit. Basit was again ignored this year when his junior Tehmina Janjua was appointed foreign secretary, replacing Chaudhry who was sent to the US as Pakistan’s ambassador."
5fb9194039aac50e6680cfe91b44992d,"Imran Khan File ImageImran Khan likely to be Pakistan's next PM: Everything you need to know about the cricketer-turned-politician Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party chief Imran Khan is heading towards victory to become the prime minister of Pakistan. The country is set to see the only civilian transfer of power in its 71-year history. The counting of votes is still underway in Pakistan for electing the new government in the country. Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was leading on as many as 114 parliamentary seats on Thursday morning while its main rival Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) was ahead on 63 seats, according to ARY News.The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of former president Asif Ali Zardari was leading on 41 seats, a sign indicating that he could play a ‘kingmaker’ in case of a hung parliament, according to media reports.The high-voltage campaign in Pakistan was marred by violence, including an IS-claimed attack on July 13 that killed nearly 150 people. Political controversies over the arrest of convicted prime minister Nawaz Sharif, too continued to dominate the elections. Not one Pakistani prime minister has completed his term yet. Imran KhanImran KhanPakistan’s National Assembly comprises a total of 342 members, of which 272 are directly elected whereas the rest - 60 seats reserved for women and 10 for religious minorities - are selected later through proportional representation among parties with more than five per cent of the vote.A party can only form the government if it manages to clinch 172 seats in total. Imran Khan, born and raised in an affluent ethnic Pashtun family in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore, currently holds the position of the chief of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party. The 65-year-old leader was schooled at Lahore's elite all-boys Aitchison College, while he graduated from Oxford University in 1975 with a Bachelor's degree in philosophy, politics and economics.In 1992, 'Captain' Khan led Pakistan to its first and only victory at the 1992 World Cup in Australia. Later when Khan decided to retire from the game, he devoted his time majorly to philanthropy and social work.Imran Khan launched Pakistan's first specialised cancer centre, Shaukat Khanum, named after his late mother who passed away due to the disease.Khan, later in 2008, also established a private technical college in Punjab's rural Mianwali district, called Namal College.In 1996, Khan made his foray into politics, founding his centrist PTI party with a promise of ensuring ""insaf"" (justice) for all.While being at the helm in the party, Khan won his first seat in the National Assembly during the 2002 general elections. Khan had contested from his paternal ancestral hometown of Mianwali, Punjab.Imran KhanImran KhanLater on, after a provincial victory in the 2013 general elections, PTI governed the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province for five years.Khan has long been a critic of the now-convicted former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif. Imran Khan led protests against Sharif in 2014, demanding that the government led by Sharif's ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), resign over alleged poll-rigging.Watch this space for more updates on pakistan election, pakistan election results, imran khan, pakistan, pakistan election result, pakistan election 2018 polls, pakistan news, pakistan election results live, pakistan election imran khan, imran khan pakistan election, pak election, pak election results, pakistan election news, pakistan elections, pakistan election 2018, Pakistan Election Results, Imran Khan, Pakistan, pakistan election result, live news, pakistan election 2018 polls, pakistan news, imran khan pakistan election, pakistan election imran khan"
6d0557f318ffd840c35111d81ca0b59f,"Scolded for doing little, leader after leader promised the United Nations on Monday to do more to prevent a warming world from reaching even more dangerous levels.As they made their pledges at the Climate Action Summit, though, they and others conceded it was not enough. And even before they spoke, teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg shamed them over and over for their inaction: “How dare you?”Secretary-General Antonio Guterres concluded the summit by listing 77 countries that committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, 70 nations pledging to do more to fight climate change, with 100 business leaders promising to join the green economy and one-third of the global banking sector signing up to green goals.“Action by action, the tide is turning,” he said. “But we have a long way to go.”Businesses and charities also got in on the act, at times even going bigger than major nations. Microsoft founder Bill Gates announced Monday that his foundation, along with The World Bank and some European governments, would provide $790 million in financial help to 300 million of the world’s small farmers adapt to climate change. The Gates foundation pledged $310 million of that.“The world can still prevent the absolute worst effects of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing new technologies and sources of energy,” Gates said. “But the effects of rising temperatures are already under way.”As the day went on Monday and the promises kept coming, the United States seemed out in the cold.Before world leaders made their promises in three-minute speeches, the 16-year-old Thunberg gave an emotional appeal in which she scolded the leaders with her repeated phrase, “How dare you.”“This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be up here,” said Thunberg, who began a lone protest outside the Swedish parliament more than a year ago that culminated in Friday’s global climate strikes.“I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you have come to us young people for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”“We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and yet all you can talk about is money,” Thunberg said. “You are failing us.”Later, she and 15 other youth activists filed a formal complaint with an arm of the U.N. that protects children, saying that governments’ lack of action on warming is violating their basic rights.U.S. President Donald Trump mocked Thunberg on Twitter, writing: “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!”Outside experts say they heard a lot of talk Monday but not the promised action needed to keep warming to a few tenths of a degree. They say it won’t produce the dramatic changes the world requires.“Sometimes I feel that Greta is still out in front of the Swedish parliament out on her own,” said Stanford University’s Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, which targets carbon emissions across the world.Bill Hare, who follows national emissions and promises for Climate Action Tracker, called what was said “deeply disappointing” and not adding up to much.“The ball they are moving forward is a ball of promises,” said economist John Reilly, co-director of MIT’s Joint Center for Global Change. “Where the ‘ball’ of actual accomplishments is, is another question.”Of all the countries that came up short, World Resources Institute Vice President Helen Mountford said one stood out: the United States for “not coming to the table and engaging.”“What we’ve seen so far is not the kind of climate leadership we need from the major economies,” Mountford said. She did say, however, that businesses, as well as small- and medium-sized countries had “exciting initiatives.”Nations such as Finland and Germany promised to ban coal within a decade. Several also mentioned goals of climate neutrality — when a country is not adding more heat-trapping carbon to the air than is being removed by plants and perhaps technology — by 2050.Trump dropped by the summit, listened to German Chancellor Angela Merkel make detailed pledges — including going coal-free — and left without saying anything.The United States did not ask to speak at the summit, U.N. officials said. And Guterres had told countries they couldn’t be on the agenda without making bold new proposals.Even though there was no speech by Trump — who has denied climate change, called it a Chinese hoax and repealed U.S. carbon-reduction policies — he was talked about.In a jibe at Trump’s plans to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said countries “must honor our commitments and follow through on the Paris Agreement.”“The withdrawal of certain parties will not shake the collective goal of the world community,” Wang said to applause. Also Monday, Russia announced that it had ratified the Paris pact, which it had signed already.Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the U.N.’s special climate envoy, thanked Trump for stopping by, adding that it might prove useful “when you formulate climate policy,” drawing laughter and applause on the General Assembly floor.Thunberg told the U.N. that even the strictest emission cuts being talked about only gives the world a 50% chance of limiting future warming to another 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 degrees Fahrenheit) from now, which is a global goal. Those odds, she said, are not good enough.“We will not let you get away with this,” Thunberg said. “Right now is where we draw the line.”As this all played out, scientists announced that Arctic sea ice reached its annual summer low and this year the ice shrank so much it tied for the second lowest mark in 40 years of monitoring.Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, said she represents “the most climate-vulnerable people on Earth.” Her tiny country has increased its emissions-cut proposals in a way that would limit warming to that tight goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times.“We are now calling on others to join us,” Heine said.Several leaders talked about getting off coal, but Climate Action Tracker’s Hare said it wasn’t enough and Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley said if the world can make driverless cars, it can tackle climate change.“There simply can be no more coal power plants after 2020 if we are serious about our future,” she said.Speaking for small nations that are already being eaten away by sea level rise and blasted by stronger storms, Mottley said, “We refuse to be relegated to the footnotes of history and be collateral damage.”“The nations of the world are not fighting a losing battle, but the nations of the world are losing this battle today,” Mottley said. “It’s within our battle to win it. The only question is: Will it be too late for the small nations of the world?”Guterres opened the summit Monday by saying: “Earth is issuing a chilling cry: Stop.”He told the more than 60 world leaders scheduled to speak that it’s not a time to negotiate but to act to make the world carbon neutral by 2050.“Time is running out,” he said. “But it is not too late.”ALSO READ | World not doing enough on climate change, warns ModiALSO READ | PM Modi speaks at UNSG's Summit on Climate Change in New YorkALSO READ | EIB to support 1 trillion euros of climate action investmentWATCH | "
afe2510104dbedf0c2564ca9ef658538,"Antonio Guterres urges G20 to act on vaccine equity, debt relief. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged the G20 member nations to address Covid-19 vaccine gap, provide debt relief to developing economies, and finance climate action.Guterres made the remarks while virtually addressing the third meeting of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, which was being held in Venice, Italy, reports Xinhua news agency.Friday's meeting was held behind closed doors, said Stephane Dujarric, chief spokesman of the UN chief.The Secretary-General reiterated his call for a global vaccination plan to at least double the production of vaccines and to ensure equitable distribution, using COVAX as the platform, said Dujarric.Guterres said many developing countries are teetering on the verge of debt default.He called on the G20 to expand the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and Common Framework for Debt Treatment to include vulnerable middle-income countries and small island developing states.On climate change, Guterres said he was deeply concerned over the lack of progress on public climate financing and once again called on the G20 to mobilise $100 billion annually for developing countries, as agreed to in 2009.Guterres told the ministers that to restore trust in multilateralism, there is a need to deliver on vaccines, economic recovery and climate finance, said the spokesman.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

851325300bcf634c335fc5b98450cc2c,"Hurricane Maria intensified into a potentially catastrophic Category 5 storm on Monday as it surged toward islands in the eastern Caribbean, and forecasters warned it might become even stronger.The storm's eye was expected to pass near Dominica during the night and then on Tuesday brush past many of the islands already wrecked by Hurricane Irma and head toward a possible direct strike on Puerto Rico on Wednesday.Related Stories 3 dead, no power for 3.3 million as Hurricane Irma batters Florida Two weeks of destruction and fear: Hurricane Irma is finally dead after 61 deaths On Dominica, zinc roofs began blowing off homes as the outer edge of the storm moved in during the evening.Authorities had closed schools and government offices on the island and urged people to move from dangerous areas to shelters.""We should treat the approaching hurricane very, very seriously,"" Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit warned. ""This much water in Dominica is dangerous.""TROPICAL STORM ERIKA KILLED 31 IN 2015In August 2015, Tropical Storm Erika unleashed flooding and landslides that killed 31 people and destroyed more than 370 homes on the small, mountainous island.Officials on nearby Guadeloupe said the French island would experience extremely heavy flooding and warned that many communities could be submerged overnight.In Martinique, authorities ordered people to remain indoors and said they should prepare for cuts to power and water. Schools and non-essential public services were closed.With Puerto Rico appearing destined for a hit, officials in the U.S. territory warned residents of wooden or otherwise flimsy homes to find safe shelter.""You have to evacuate. Otherwise you're going to die,"" said Hector Pesquera, Puerto Rico's public safety commissioner. ""I don't know how to make this any clearer.""The U.S. territory imposed rationing of basic supplies including water, milk, baby formula, canned food, batteries and flashlights.The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Maria had maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) on Monday evening. It was centered about 40 miles (70 kilometers) north of Martinique and 15 miles (25 kilometers) east-southeast of Dominica, and was heading west-northwest at 9 mph (15 kph).""Maria is developing the dreaded pinhole eye,"" the center warned.That's a sign of an extremely strong hurricane likely to get even mightier, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. Just like when a spinning ice skater brings in their arms and rotates faster, a smaller, tighter eye shows the same physics, he said.Maria's eye shrank to a narrow 10 miles (16 kilometers) across.""You just don't see those in weaker hurricanes,"" McNoldy said.Hurricane warnings were posted for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat. A tropical storm warning was issued for Antigua and Barbuda, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Maarten, St. Lucia, Martinique and Anguilla.The storm's hurricane-force winds extended about 25 miles (35 kilometers) from the eye, and tropical storm-force winds as far as 125 miles (205 kilometers).Forecasters said storm surge could raise water levels by 6 to 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) near Maria's center. The storm was predicted to bring 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain for some islands, with the possibility of higher amounts in isolated spots.The current forecast track would carry it about 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands late on Tuesday and early Wednesday, territorial Gov. Kenneth Mapp said.""We are going to have a very, very long night,"" Mapp said as he urged people in the territory to finish any preparations.St. Thomas and St. John are still recovering from a direct hit by Hurricane Irma, which did extensive damage and caused four deaths on the two islands.Officials and islanders were also bracing in Puerto Rico, which did not take a direct hit from Irma but still saw blackouts across much of the territory. Nearly 70,000 people remain without power, and Gov. Ricardo Rossello warned of an island-wide outage.""This is going to be a catastrophic event,"" he said.Forecasters said the storm would dump up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) of rain across Puerto Rico and whip the island with heavy winds for 12 to 24 hours.Officials said the Federal Emergency Management Agency was ready to bring drinking water and help restore power in Puerto Rico after the storm.Traffic was heavy Monday as people rushed to buy last-minute items. Among them was 70-year-old retiree Rafael Rivera, who clutched a small bag of dog treats for his dog and six puppies at home.""This storm is coming with some bad intentions,"" he said at a San Juan store where some shoppers grumbled about empty shelves.Rossello said Puerto Rico had prepared 500 shelters capable of taking in up to 133,000 people in a worst-case scenario. Nearly 200 people are still in shelters due to Hurricane Irma. Classes were cancelled and government employees were to work only a half-day.Farther north, long-lived Hurricane Jose continued to head northward well away from the U.S. East Coast but causing dangerous surf and rip currents. It was not expected to make landfall, but a tropical storm warning was in effect for coastal areas in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Tropical storm watches were posted for parts of New York's Long Island and Connecticut.Jose was centered about 230 miles (370 kilometers) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and was stationary. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph).Seawater washed over parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks as Jose passed, and five people were knocked off a coastal jetty in Rhode Island by high surf caused by the storm. All five were hospitalised."

The fund was created in 2013 by the young activist and her father Ziauddin to raise awareness about the impact of girls' education.She arrived in Pakistan on Thursday and was greeted with honours by the government and institutions. The activist was unable to repress her tears in a televised speech broadcast from the office of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, in which she said returning to her country had been her dream for the last five years.""Always it has been my dream that I should go to Pakistan and there, in peace and without any fear, I can move on streets, I can meet people, I can talk to people.""And I think that it's my old home again... I am grateful to all of you,"" she said.Her presence has also led to strong criticism and protests, such as the one organized by the country's main association of private schools on Friday under the slogan ""I am not Malala"".Meanwhile, in an interview with Geo TV, the activist said she plans to return to Pakistan permanently once her studies are completed.The Oxford University student, who had said that she wanted to run for Prime Minister, said there was ""definitely a difference between the Pakistan of today and in 2012"" as things were becoming ""better"".Yousafzai, the youngest-ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, plans to return to Britain on Monday."

Pompeo's statement has come in wake of India-China tension at the border after China indulged in unilateraly trying to change the status quo at the Indo-China border several time, however, the Indian forces thwarted their every attempt.Now, slamming China over its territorial aggression, Mike Pompeo said China has attempted to ""seize"" control of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India by force as part of its territorial aggression, US' national security advisor has said, underlining that time has come to accept that dialogue and agreements will not persuade Beijing to change.India and China are locked in a five-month-long tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh that has significantly strained their relations. Both sides have held a series of high-level diplomatic and military talks to resolve the border row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff.""CCP's (Chinese Communist Party) territorial aggression is also apparent on its Indian border where China has attempted to seize control of the Line of Actual Control by force,"" US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said in a remark on China early this week in Utah.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC). China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.The Chinese territorial aggression is also true in the Taiwan Strait where the PLA (People's Liberation Army) Navy and Air Force continue to conduct threatening military drills, O’Brien said.""Beijing's signature international development programme, One Belt One Road (OBOR), involves impoverished companies taking on opaque and unsustainable Chinese loans to pay Chinese firms employing Chinese labourers to build their infrastructure,"" he said.Many of these projects are unnecessary, shoddily built and are ""white elephants"", the national security advisor said.""And now these countries' dependence on the Chinese debt leaves their sovereignty eroded and with no choice but to hue to the party's line on UN votes or any other issue that the Chinese Communist Party considers a red line,"" he said.O'Brien also noted that China's other international aid efforts include selling surveillance systems and similar tools of repression to ""pariah regimes"" around the world, including Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro.""The time has come to accept that dialogue and agreements will not persuade or compel the People's Republic of China to change. There's nothing to be gained from looking the other way or turning the other cheek. We've been doing that for too long,” he said.O’Brien said the US must stand up to the Chinese and protect the American people.""We must promote American prosperity, practice peace through strength and advance American influence in the world,"" he said, adding that under President Donald Trump's leadership that is exactly what the US has done.O’Brien said the Trump administration has adopted a competitive approach to China. That approach, he said, has two primary objectives.First, improve the resiliency of US institutions, alliances and partnerships to prevail against the challenges that China presents; and the second is to impose tangible cost in order to compel Beijing to cease or reduce actions harmful to America's vital national interest and those of its allied and partner nations.""President Trump has taken decisive action to meet these objectives. He is working to prevent companies that answer to the CCP's intelligence and security apparatus,” O’Brien said.Citing examples, he said Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE have been prevented from accessing Americans' personal and private data and national secrets.The Trump administration, he said, has also imposed import and export restrictions on US semiconductor technology and other exports going to Huawei and similar Chinese telecommunications corporations.“Our democratic partners are starting to follow. Just last month, the UK joined democracies such as the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Sweden in committing to using trusted suppliers to build their future 5G networks,” O’Brien said.""Carriers like Jio in India, Telstra in Australia, SK and KT in South Korea, NTT in Japan, and others have prohibited the use of Huawei equipment in their networks. The Trump administration is investigating and prosecuting the economic espionage aggressively,"" he said.O’Brien said the Trump administration has strengthened its military relationships in the Indo Pacific.“One important partnership which will be one of the most key partnerships for the United States in the 21st century, India, is thriving,"" he said.He also noted that the US has signed extended US military access to Singapore's air and naval bases. The country is also working closely with Japan, Australia and New Zealand to strengthen relationships with the Pacific Islands, especially Timor. It is also working closely with Mongolia.However, O’Brien said even as the US competes with China, it does welcome cooperation where America's interests align.""The US has a deep and abiding respect for the Chinese people and enjoys longstanding ties to that country, including our alliance in World War II,"" O’Brien said.(With inputs from PTI)ALSO READ | After coronavirus, Trump aims to get campaign back on track "

All three new locally transmitted cases were reported in Guangdong Province, it said.Officials said 2,000 Chinese nationals were brought home in 16 chartered flights.All of the new arrivals are being screened in different cities other than Beijing. China has banned the entry of foreign nationals by cancelling all existing visas.As of Monday, China has reported a total of 1,464 imported cases of which 905 are still undergoing treatment.Worrying proposition for Chinese health officials are the growing number of asymptomatic cases which climbed to 1,005 with 54 new cases.Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the novel coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.The overall confirmed cases in China had reached 82,249 by Monday, including 3,341 people who died of the disease, 1,170 patients still being treated and 77,738 people discharged after recovery, NHC said.By Monday, 1,009 confirmed cases, including four deaths, had been reported in Hong Kong, 45 confirmed cases in the Macao and 393 in Taiwan, including six deaths, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Considering the increase of the recurring COVID-19 cases, a high-powered committee to control the virus headed by Premier Li Keqiang on Monday called for stringent measures to control the spread.Noting the recurring sporadic cases in certain localities, the meeting called for keeping up community-level containment, an official statement said.""It required that all control measures be enforced down to each household and individual and applied to Chinese and foreigners in the same way, to avert the further spread of infection,"" it said."

In a statement on Monday, the White House said the President's action authorises the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate relief efforts to alleviate the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population.The emergency in Washington DC will be effective from Monday till January 24.It comes in the wake of last week's violent protest, in which thousands of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building and clashed with police, interrupting a constitutional process by Congress to affirm the victory of President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in the election. Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died in the protests.According to the White House, the emergency declaration also provides appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorised under Title V of the Stafford Act to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the District of Columbia.Specifically, the FEMA is authorised to identify, mobilise, and provide at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency.Emergency protective measures, limited to direct Federal assistance, will be provided at 100 per cent Federal funding, the White House said.Thomas J Fargione from the DHS and Pete Gaynor, Administrator, FEMA, are the Federal Coordinating Officers for operations in the affected area.The Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned of armed protests at all 50 US state capitals, including Washington, in the lead up to next week's 59th Presidential inauguration. Similarly, the US National Guard Bureau has also warned of possible riots next week."

Facebook and its photo and video-sharing social networking service, Instagram, suspended Trump after his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6 that left five people dead and led to his second impeachment.The Oversight Board, an independent body created by Facebook three years ago, on Thursday said it has accepted a case referral from the social media giant to examine its decision to indefinitely suspend Trump's access to post content on Facebook and Instagram.Facebook has also requested policy recommendations from the board on suspensions when the user is a political leader.Facebook's decision to suspend Trump’s access to post on Facebook and Instagram has driven intense global interest. The Oversight Board has been closely following events in the US and Facebook’s response to them, and the board is ready to provide a thorough and independent assessment of the company’s decision, it said.""A decision by the Board on this case will be binding on Facebook, and determine whether Mr Trump’s suspension from access to Facebook and Instagram for an indefinite amount of time is overturned,” the board said in a press release.Facebook has committed not to restore access to its platforms unless directed by a decision of the Oversight Board. Facebook must consider any accompanying policy recommendations from the board and publicly respond to them, it said.According to the Oversight Board, in the coming days, the case will be assigned to a five-member case review panel.

711f85ced372ff06621f01147f4d9cf2,"Déjà vu 2016? Russia back to stirring chaos in U.S. electionJust weeks into this year’s election cycle, Russia already is actively interfering in the U.S. presidential campaign in hopes of reelecting President Donald Trump, and is also trying to help the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side, intelligence officials have concluded.The Russian efforts are aimed at undermining public confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections and stirring general chaos in American politics, intelligence experts say.Lawmakers were told in a classified briefing last week that Russia is taking steps that would help Trump, according to officials familiar with the briefing. And Sanders acknowledged Friday that he was briefed l ast month by U.S. officials about Russian efforts to boost his candidacy.The revelations demonstrate that the specter of foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election will almost certainly be a cloud over the campaign, and possibly even the final results if the contest is close. Democrats have consistently criticized Trump for not doing more to deter the Russians and others, and now they have fresh evidence to support their concerns.Sanders condemned Russia and called on President Vladimir Putin to steer clear of U.S. politics.“I don’t care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president,” Sanders said. “My message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do.”Trump took a different tack in responding to news that the House Intelligence Committee earlier this month had been briefed by U.S. intelligence experts that Russia was attempting to ensure his reelection.On Friday he sought to minimize the new warnings by his government intelligence experts and revived old grievances in claiming any problem was just Democrats trying to undermine the legitimacy of his presidency.The president started the day on Twitter, claiming that Democrats were pushing a “misinformation campaign” in hopes of politically damaging him.Later, making light of the intelligence findings at a campaign rally in Las Vegas, he suggested that Russia might actually prefer Sanders in the White House.“Wouldn’t he rather have, let’s say, Bernie?” Trump said. ”Wouldn’t he rather have Bernie, who honeymooned in Moscow?”The fresh warnings about Russian interference came in what has been a tumultuous stretch for the intelligence community.A day after the Feb. 13 briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Trump berated the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire in a meeting at the White House. Then this week, Trump abruptly announced that Maguire would be replaced by Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist who also will hold the job in an acting capacity.In addition to Maguire, two other senior officials will soon leave the agency.Andrew Hallman, one of Maguire’s top deputies, announced Friday he would leaving. He is expected to return to the CIA, where he has spent more than 30 years, according to an official familiar with the move, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the personnel move. Jason Klitenic, the general counsel for the national intelligence director’s office, is returning to private practice. Klitenic’s departure is unrelated to the sudden shakeup by Trump.Former CIA Director John Brennan told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday that Trump’s ouster of Maguire and Hallman was a “virtual decapitation of the intelligence community.”Like Trump, Sanders appeared to suggest there was a political motive to the revelations about Russian interference. Nevada Democrats are to hold their nominating contest on Saturday.“One day before the Nevada caucus, why do you think it came out?” he said.Trump erupted when he learned last week about the briefing to House members, according to a senior administration official familiar with the matter. It was unclear whether he was aware of the specific information briefed, but he was agitated that contents of the briefing could be politically damaging to him, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to dicuss sensitive matters.Trump tweeted Friday that he was considering four candidates to serve as permanent intelligence director and said he expected to make a decision within the next few weeks. He told reporters Thursday evening that Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia was among those he’s considering.But Collins, who is vying for one of Georgia’s Senate seats, said Friday he’s not interested in the job overseeing the nation’s 17 spy agencies.The installation of Grenell, even in a temporary role, has raised questions among critics about whether Trump is more interested in having a loyalist than someone steeped in the complicated inner workings of international intelligence.Grenell has a background that is primarily in politics and media affairs. Most recently, he’s been serving as Trump’s ambassador to Germany.The Democratic chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, dismissed Grenell as someone who, “by all accounts, rose to prominence in the Trump administration because of his personal devotion to Donald Trump and penchant for trolling the President’s perceived enemies on Twitter.”From the start of his presidency three years ago, Trump has been dogged by insecurity over his loss of the popular vote in the general election and a persistent frustration that the legitimacy of his presidency is being challenged by Democrats and the media, aides and associates say. He’s also aggressively played down U.S. findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.In addition to those findings by the major intelligence agencies, a nearly two-year investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller concluded there was a sophisticated, Kremlin-led operation to sow division in the U.S. and upend the 2016 election by using cyberattacks and social media as weapons.Russia also took steps to support Sanders in the 2016 presidential campaign, according to a criminal indictment against a Russian troll farm and Mueller’s lengthy report.Mueller charged 13 Russians in a covert social media campaign that prosecutors said was aimed at dividing public opinion on hot-button social issues as well propping up Sanders and Republican candidate Donald Trump while denigrating Hillary Clinton, the eventual 2016 Democratic nominee.Organizers of that Russian effort circulated an outline of themes for future social media content, with instructions to “use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump—we support them),” according to the indictment.According to a Senate Intelligence committee report, an account operated on the social media platform Tumblr and operated by the Internet Research Agency — a Russian company charged by Mueller’s team of prosecutors with running a covert disinformation campaign — posted content that promoted the 2016 Sanders campaign and denigrated the rival Clinton campaign. One post on that account, according to the report, included a video of Clinton calling young black gang members “superpredators,”Moscow has denied any meddling. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the newest allegations are “paranoid reports that, unfortunately, there will be more and more of as we get closer to the elections (in the U.S.). Of course, they have nothing to do with the truth.”"
34008e56e633d2f70f58a98fe379ea6f,"NYPD ambushed twice in 12 hoursA gunman was arrested after he ambushed police officers in the Bronx twice in 12 hours, authorities said, wounding two in attacks that brought outrage from officials who blamed the violence on an atmosphere of anti-police rhetoric.Robert Williams, 45, of the Bronx, was captured after he walked into a police station in the Bronx and started shooting shortly before 8 a.m. Sunday, police said. His shots struck a lieutenant in the arm and narrowly missed other police personnel before he ran out of bullets, lay down and tossed his pistol, officials said.That attack came just hours after Williams approached a patrol van in the same part of the Bronx and fired at two officers inside, wounding one before escaping on foot, police said.All of those shot are expected to recover, authorities said.“It is only by the grace of God and the heroic actions of those inside the building that took him into custody that we are not talking about police officers murdered inside a New York City police precinct,” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a news conference.Williams is being charged with attempted murder, criminal weapon possession and resisting arrest, police said in an email late Sunday identifying him as the suspect. He was hospitalized Sunday evening, the Bronx prosecutor’s office said. It wasn’t clear whether he had an attorney to speak for him.Williams had been upset since his own son died after being shot in the Bronx, the suspect’s grandmother told the New York Post.“He was depressed at times because his son got shot in the street,” Mary Williams, 80, told the newspaper. “That was his only child.”The officer injured in the first shooting, Paul Stroffolino, was released from the hospital Sunday to applause from colleagues. The officer, a bandage on his neck, gave a thumbs-up.Shea called Williams a “coward” and said he had a long criminal history, including a 2002 shooting and carjacking in which he fired a gun at police. He was paroled from prison in 2017 after an attempted murder conviction, Shea said.The commissioner also lashed out at criminal justice reform activists who have demonstrated in recent months against excessive force by police, including a large protest in Grand Central Terminal. The protests, he suggested, helped create an anti-police environment.“These things are not unrelated. We had people marching through the streets of New York City recently,” Shea said. “Words matter. And words affect people’s behavior.”Shea didn’t offer any evidence that Williams knew of those protests or was influenced by them.Mayor Bill de Blasio, who won office partly on a promise to reform overly aggressive policing of minority communities, also suggested that anti-police sentiment had gotten out of hand.“Anyone who spews hatred at our officers is aiding and abetting this kind of atmosphere; it is not acceptable,” de Blasio said. “You could protest for whatever you believe in, but you cannot vilely attack those who are here to protect us. It creates this kind of dynamic.”The attacks recalled other unprovoked assaults on police officers sitting in their patrol vehicles.In 2017, a gunman killed Officer Miosotis Familia as she sat in her patrol vehicle in the Bronx. In 2014, two officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, were shot dead in their patrol car in Brooklyn by a man upset about recent police killings of unarmed black men.The killings of Ramos and Liu had also followed large protests. Some officers blamed de Blasio for expressing solidarity with the demonstrations and turned their backs on the Democrat at the funerals.Robert Gangi, executive director of the Police Reform Organizing Project advocacy group, said it was “irresponsible” for Shea and de Blasio to link the weekend’s violence to recent demonstrations, which he said involved activists “protesting in a legitimate fashion.”There is “no defense for a lunatic who opens fire on police,” Gangi said.The first attack happened just before 8:30 p.m. Saturday, when the gunman walked up to the van asking the officers for directions and then fired shots, grazing Stroffolino, who was behind the wheel, in the chin and neck and narrowly missing an artery, authorities said.Stroffolino and his partner for eight years, Brian Hanlon, a friend since middle school, hit the gas to get away. Neither fired a shot.Police released a photo of the suspect and were combing the city for him when he walked into the police station coordinating the manhunt, strolled to the desk and pulled a gun, authorities said. The wounded lieutenant returned fire but missed, and police personnel dashed out of an adjoining room just in time to avoid the pursuing gunman.Two security cameras captured video of the chaotic scene."

Maduro’s speech was abruptly cut short and soldiers could be seen breaking ranks and scattering.“At exactly 5:41 pm in the afternoon several explosions were heard,” Rodriguez said in a live address to the nation minutes after the incident. “The investigation clearly reveals they came from drone-like devices that carried explosives.”But firefighters at the scene of the blast disputed the government’s version of events.Three local authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case said the incident was actually a gas tank explosion inside an apartment near the site of Maduro’s speech.Smoke could be seen coming out a building window.Image Source : APIn this still from a video provided by Venezolana de Television, Presiden Nicolas Maduro, center, delivers his speech as his wife Cilia Flores winces and looks up after being startled by and explosion, in Caracas, Venezuela, Saturday, Aug 4, 2018. In this still from a video provided by Venezolana de Television, Presiden Nicolas Maduro, center, delivers his speech as his wife Cilia Flores winces and looks up after being startled by and explosion, in Caracas, Venezuela, Saturday, Aug 4, 2018. Venezuela’s government routinely accuses opposition activists of plotting to attack and overthrow Maduro, a deeply unpopular leader who was recently elected to a new term in office in a vote decried by dozens of nations. Maduro has steadily moved to concentrate power as the nation reels from a crippling economic crisis.Adding to the confusion, a previously unknown group calling itself Soldiers in T-shirts claimed responsibility, saying it planned to fly two drones loaded with explosives at the president, but government soldiers shot them down before reaching its target. The Associated Press could not independently verify the authenticity of the message.“We showed that they are vulnerable,” the tweet said. “It was not successful today, but it is just a matter of time.”The organization did not respond to a message from The Associated Press seeking more information.In the midst of near-daily protests last year, a rogue police officer flew a stolen helicopter over the capital and launched grenades at several government buildings. Oscar Perez was later killed in a deadly gun battle after over six months on the lam.“The right insists on violence to take public spaces that they can’t win with votes,” Diosdado Cabello, a high-ranking socialist party leader, wrote on Twitter Saturday after the apparent assault, which he characterized as a “terrorist attack.”State television was broadcasting Maduro’s speech at the National Guard anniversary live when the incident took place.“We are going to bet for the good of our country,” Maduro declared triumphantly moments before the sound of an explosion pierced the air. “The hour of the economy recovery has come.”Seconds later Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, looked up to the sky and winced.The cameras then turned to a wide shot of uniformed military officers standing at attention in neat lines as they broke rank and began running. The transmission then cut off.Images being shared on social media showed officers surrounding Maduro with what appeared to be a black bullet-proof barrier as they escorted him from the site."
132ac65fccde4e71b00e55a45a8a9137,"Donald TrumpPresident Donald Trump said Saturday that military action against Iran was still an option for its downing of an unmanned U.S. military aircraft, but amid heightened tensions, he dangled the prospect of eventually becoming an unlikely “best friend” of America’s longtime Middle Eastern adversary. Trump also said “we very much appreciate” that Iran’s Revolutionary Guard chose not to target a U.S. spy plane carrying more than 30 people. The president’s softer tone Saturday marked a stark contrast to the anti-Iran rhetoric he employed throughout the presidential campaign and presidency, including his use of punishing economic sanctions in an attempt to pressure Iran to give up its quest to build nuclear weapons. “The fact is we’re not going to have Iran have a nuclear weapon,” he said as he left the White House for a weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat. “And when they agree to that, they are going to have a wealthy country, they’re going to be so happy and I’m going to be their best friend.” “I hope that happens. I hope that happens, but it may not,” Trump said. He later said Iran will be hit with unspecified new sanctions on Monday. Another event earlier this week put a different cast on Trump’s more optimistic rhetoric. U.S. military cyber forces launched a strike against Iranian military computer systems on Thursday in response to the loss of the military drone. U.S. officials told The Associated Press that the cyberattacks, which disabled Iranian computer systems that controlled its rocket and missile launchers, had been authorized by Trump. President Donald Trump said Saturday he's still considering military action against Iran after it downed an unmanned US military aircraft, saying the use of force is ""always on the table until we get this solved."" (June 22) On Saturday, days after he said it was “hard to believe” the shoot-down of the U.S. drone was intentional, Trump did an about-face and accused Iran of “knowingly” targeting the plane. And he reiterated that he aborted a planned military strike set for Thursday after learning approximately 150 Iranians would be killed. “Everybody was saying I’m a war monger. And now they say I’m a dove. And I think I’m neither, if you want to know the truth,” Trump told reporters. “I’m a man with common sense. And that’s what we need in this country, is common sense. But I didn’t like the idea of them knowingly shooting down an unmanned drone and then we kill 150 people.” He added: “I don’t want to kill 150 Iranians. I don’t want to kill 150 of anything or anybody unless it’s absolutely necessary.’” Trump’s comments came as Iran summoned the United Arab Emirates’ top envoy to Tehran to protest the neighboring Arab nation’s decision to allow the U.S. to use one of its military bases to launch the drone that Iran says entered its airspace, state media reported Saturday. Iran issued a “strong protest” to the UAE diplomat, saying Iran does not tolerate the facilitation of foreign forces that violate its territory, the report by the official IRNA news agency said. The U.S. said its RQ-4A Global Hawk was shot down Thursday over international waters in the Strait of Hormuz, not inside Iranian airspace. The shoot-down by elite Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces marked the first time the Islamic Republic directly attacked the American military amid mounting tensions over Tehran’s unraveling nuclear deal with world powers. The two countries disputed the circumstances leading up to an Iranian surface-to-air missile bringing down the drone, an unmanned aircraft with a wingspan larger than a Boeing 737 jetliner and costing over $100 million. British diplomat Andrew Murrison planned to visit Iran on Sunday to call for the “urgent de-escalation in the region and raise U.K. and international concerns about Iran’s regional conduct” during talks with Tehran’s government, Britain’s Foreign Office said in a statement Saturday. Trump said U.S. sanctions on Iran have turned the country into an “economic mess” and he tweeted later Saturday about new penalties to be imposed on Monday, without providing details. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday that Iran’s financial sector would be penalized soon if it doesn’t work to stop evading international guidelines designed to combat money laundering. The drone incident immediately heightened the crisis already gripping the wider region, which is rooted in Trump withdrawing the U.S. a year ago from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal and imposing crippling new sanctions on Tehran. Recently, Iran quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium to be on pace to break one of the deal’s terms by next week, while threatening to raise enrichment closer to weapons-grade levels on July 7 if Europe doesn’t offer it a new deal. In Iraq, security measures were increased at one of the country’s largest air bases, which houses American trainers, a top Iraqi air force commander said Saturday. The U.S. military said operations at the base were going on as usual and there were no plans to evacuate personnel.

But I didn’t like the idea of them knowingly shooting down an unmanned drone and then we kill 150 people.”He added: “I don’t want to kill 150 Iranians. I don’t want to kill 150 of anything or anybody unless it’s absolutely necessary.’”Trump’s comments came as Iran summoned the United Arab Emirates’ top envoy to Tehran to protest the neighboring Arab nation’s decision to allow the U.S. to use one of its military bases to launch the drone that Iran says entered its airspace, state media reported Saturday.Iran issued a “strong protest” to the UAE diplomat, saying Iran does not tolerate the facilitation of foreign forces that violate its territory, the report by the official IRNA news agency said.The U.S. said its RQ-4A Global Hawk was shot down Thursday over international waters in the Strait of Hormuz, not inside Iranian airspace.The shoot-down by elite Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces marked the first time the Islamic Republic directly attacked the American military amid mounting tensions over Tehran’s unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.The two countries disputed the circumstances leading up to an Iranian surface-to-air missile bringing down the drone, an unmanned aircraft with a wingspan larger than a Boeing 737 jetliner and costing over $100 million.British diplomat Andrew Murrison planned to visit Iran on Sunday to call for the “urgent de-escalation in the region and raise U.K. and international concerns about Iran’s regional conduct” during talks with Tehran’s government, Britain’s Foreign Office said in a statement Saturday.Trump said U.S. sanctions on Iran have turned the country into an “economic mess” and he tweeted later Saturday about new penalties to be imposed on Monday, without providing details. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday that Iran’s financial sector would be penalized soon if it doesn’t work to stop evading international guidelines designed to combat money laundering.The drone incident immediately heightened the crisis already gripping the wider region, which is rooted in Trump withdrawing the U.S. a year ago from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal and imposing crippling new sanctions on Tehran.Recently, Iran quadrupled its production of low-enriched uranium to be on pace to break one of the deal’s terms by next week, while threatening to raise enrichment closer to weapons-grade levels on July 7 if Europe doesn’t offer it a new deal.In Iraq, security measures were increased at one of the country’s largest air bases, which houses American trainers, a top Iraqi air force commander said Saturday. The U.S. military said operations at the base were going on as usual and there were no plans to evacuate personnel.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1; firstjw = document.getElementsByClassName('jwvidplayer')[0]; cs_jw_script = document.createElement('script'); cs_jw_script.src = 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/internal-c2/plugins/streamingtag_plugin_jwplayer.js'; firstjw.parentNode.insertBefore(cs_jw_script, firstjw.nextSibling); }   var jwconfig_5119768245 = { ""file"": ""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_7sohrtok_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8"", ""image"": ""https://thumbs.indiatvnews.com/vod/0_7sohrtok_big_thumb.jpg"", ""title"": ""US President Donald Trump approved strikes on Iran but pulled back"", ""height"": ""440px"", ""width"": ""100%"", ""aspectratio"": ""16:9"", ""autostart"": false, ""controls"": true, ""mute"": false, ""volume"": 25, ""floating"": false, ""sharing"": { ""code"": """", ""sites"": [ ""facebook"", ""twitter"", ""email"" ] }, ""stretching"": ""exactfit"", ""primary"": ""html5"", ""hlshtml"": true, ""sharing_link"": """", ""advertising"": { ""client"": ""vast"", ""autoplayadsmuted"": true, ""skipoffset"": 5, ""cuetext"": """", ""skipmessage"": ""Skip ad in xx"", ""skiptext"": ""SKIP"", ""preloadAds"": true, ""schedule"": [ { ""offset"": ""pre"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PreRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" }, { ""offset"": ""50%"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_MidRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="" }, { ""offset"": ""post"", ""tag"": ""https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/8323530/Eng_Video_Desktop_PostRoll&description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiatvnews.com&tfcd=0&npa=0&sz=640x480&gdfp_req=1&output=vast&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&correlator="", ""type"": ""linear"" } ] } }; var jwvidplayer_5119768245 = ''; jwsetup_5119768245(); function jwsetup_5119768245() { jwvidplayer_5119768245 = jwplayer(""jwvidplayer_5119768245"").setup(jwconfig_5119768245); jwvidplayer_5119768245.on('ready', function () { ns_.StreamingAnalytics.JWPlayer(jwvidplayer_5119768245, { publisherId: ""20465327"", labelmapping: ""c2=\""20465327\"", c3=\""IndiaTV News\"", c4=\""null\"", c6=\""null\"", ns_st_mp=\""jwplayer\"", ns_st_cl=\""0\"", ns_st_ci=\""0_7sohrtok\"", ns_st_pr=\""US President Donald Trump approved strikes on Iran but pulled back\"", ns_st_sn=\""0\"", ns_st_en=\""0\"", ns_st_ep=\""US President Donald Trump approved strikes on Iran but pulled back\"", ns_st_ct=\""null\"", ns_st_ge=\""News\"", ns_st_st=\""US President Donald Trump approved strikes on Iran but pulled back\"", ns_st_ce=\""0\"", ns_st_ia=\""0\"", ns_st_ddt=\""2019-06-22\"", ns_st_tdt=\""2019-06-22\"", ns_st_pu=\""IndiaTV News\"", ns_st_cu=\""https://indiatv-vh.akamaihd.net/i/vod/0_7sohrtok_,20,21,22,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8\"", ns_st_ty=\""video\"""" }); }); jwvidplayer_5119768245.on('all', function (r) { if (jwvidplayer_5119768245.getState() == 'error' || jwvidplayer_5119768245.getState() == 'setupError') { jwvidplayer_5119768245.stop(); jwvidplayer_5119768245.remove(); jwvidplayer_5119768245 = ''; jwsetup_5119768245(); return; } }); jwvidplayer_5119768245.on('error', function (t) { jwvidplayer_5119768245.stop(); jwvidplayer_5119768245.remove(); jwvidplayer_5119768245 = ''; jwsetup_5119768245(); return; }); jwvidplayer_5119768245.on('mute', function () { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_5119768245.on('adPlay', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_5119768245.on('adPause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_5119768245.on('pause', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_5119768245.on('error', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); jwvidplayer_5119768245.on('adBlock', function (event) { ga('send', 'event', 'JW Player Events', 'Errors', event.message); }); }  "

The Islamic State group’s Aamaq news agency said in a statement early Sunday that the assailant carried out the attack in response to the group’s calls for supporters to target members of the US-led military coalition squeezing the extremists out of Iraq and Syria. The Aamaq statement did not provide evidence for its claim or details on the assailant’s identity.France’s military has been active in the coalition since 2014, and Islamic State adherents have killed more than 200 people in France in recent years, including the 130 who died in the coordinated November 2015 attacks in Paris.Image Source : APScientific police officers investigate after a knife attack in central Paris, Saturday, May 12, 2018.

Hundreds of Kashmiris remain in preventive detention, including key political figures,” says the letter.The senators have further demanded an assessment of the overall situation in Jammu and Kashmir, including a review of those detained by the authorities and restrictions on religious freedom and internet among others, in their communication. The bipartisan letter has set a deadline of 30 days for the assessments to be carried out.The crucial letter to Pompeo comes less than two weeks ahead of President Donald Trump’s maiden visit to India. Trump, along with the US First Lady Melania Trump, will be on a two-day state visit to the country over February 24 and 25, during which he is scheduled to travel to New Delhi and Ahmedabad.India’s decision to abrogate Article 370 has repeatedly been brought up by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on various international fora.

What is happening now, he said, ""is tantamount to an all-out assault on democracy.""Zeid's criticism came a day after three Maldives Supreme Court justices annulled their earlier order to free the imprisoned opposition politicians after two of the court's justices were arrested.The annulment came after Yameen declared the state of emergency, which gives officials sweeping powers to make arrests, search and seize property and restrict freedom of assembly.The UN and many foreign governments including the United States, Britain and India have expressed concern over the state of emergency and have urged Yameen to respect the earlier court order.Hours after the emergency was declared, security forces in riot gear stormed the Supreme Court building, arresting the two judges, including Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed. It was not immediately clear what charges they face, if any.Security forces also arrested former dictator and opposition politician Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. His lawyer, Maumoon Hameed, said Gayoom faced charges including bribery and attempting to overthrow the government.Gayoom was president from 1978 to 2008, when the Maldives became a multiparty democracy.The Maldives is an archipelago of more than 1,000 islands with fewer than 400,000 citizens, more than one-third of them living in the crowded capital city, Male.Tourism now dominates the economy, with wealthy foreigners flown to hyper-expensive resort islands.But it remains, in many ways, a small community. Gayoom, the former dictator, is the half brother of President Yameen. The two men are now political enemies. Former President Mohamed Nasheed, now the opposition leader, unseated Gayoom in the country's first democratic elections in 2008. He and Gayoom are now political allies in an opposition alliance."

A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico before dawn on Tuesday, killing one man, injuring others and collapsing buildings in the southern part of the island.Cars, cots and plastic chairs became temporary beds for hundreds of families who lost their homes in southwest Puerto Rico as a flurry of earthquakes struck the island, one of them the strongest in a century. The magnitude 6.4 quake that struck before dawn on Tuesday killed one person, injured nine others and knocked out power across the U.S. territory, and a majority of Puerto Ricans remained without electricity early Wednesday. In addition, nearly 750 people were staying in government shelters in the island’s southwest region as Gov. Wanda Vázquez declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard.The hardest hit municipality was the southwest coastal town of Guánica. More than 200 people had taken shelter in a gymnasium after a quake on Monday, only for the latest shake to damage that structure — forcing them to sleep outside.Image Source : APThe Adripina Seda public school stands partially collapsed after an earthquake struck Guanica, Puerto Rico, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020.

A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck Puerto Rico before dawn on Tuesday, killing one man, injuring others and collapsing buildings in the southern part of the islandAmong them was 80-year-old Lupita Martínez, who sat in the dusty parking lot with her 96-year-old husband by her side. He was sleeping in a makeshift bed, a dark blue coat covering him.“There’s no power. There’s no water. There is nothing. This is horrible,” Martínez said.The couple was alone, lamenting that their caretaker had disappeared and was not answering their calls. Like many Puerto Ricans affected by the quake, they had children in the U.S. mainland who urged them to move there, at least until the earth stops shaking.Image Source : APHomes are damaged after an earthquake struck Guanica, Puerto Rico, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020.

Just in Guánica, a town of roughly 15,000 people, nearly 150 homes were affected by the quake, along with three schools, including one three-story structure whose first two floors were completely flattened.Image Source : APThe Adripina Seda public school stands partially collapsed after an earthquake struck Guanica, Puerto Rico, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020.

Many had their belongings in large garbage bags as they sat haphazardly on unstable plastic chairs. Some slept. Others cradled their dogs and many simply stared listlessly into the distance. One elderly man spent an entire day in his wheelchair, refusing to lay down on a cot.Meanwhile, a handful of people slept in their cars, in chairs or on the ground as cots ran out.Image Source : APHomes are damaged after an earthquake struck Guanica, Puerto Rico, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2020.

Among them was Dayleen Ortiz, who set up a speaker on the roof of her car to blast uplifting salsa music and provided crayons and paper to children and urged adults to shake their fears.“There is a lot of uncertainty,” she said. “We don’t know if this is going to continue.”One young girl tapped Ortiz on her leg repeatedly: “I want to play beautician,” she said.Ortiz dug behind cases of water bottles, chairs and blankets in her car and produced eight small new nail polishes and the girl smiled wide. It’s a trick the psychologist learned to entertain children after Hurricane Maria hit, causing an estimated 2,975 deaths and more than $100 billion in estimated damage.Reconstruction has been slow, and the earthquake was the newest blow to an island where thousands of people have been living under a blue tarps since the hurricane and the power grid remains fragile.“I can’t stand this,”said 64-year-old Zenaida Rodríguez as she sat under a tree and the ground again rumbled. “Did you feel that?”"
703b02820f8c1f9e36e951c50540441f,"The Biden administration on Monday renewed genocide allegations against China for repression of Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in its northwest Xinjiang region.The Biden administration on Monday renewed genocide allegations against China for repression of Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in its northwest Xinjiang region.It also warned Eritrea, Ethiopia, Myanmar and South Sudan of possible further sanctions for ethnic cleansing in conflicts they are involved in. The administration sent the messages in the release of the State Department's annual report to Congress on genocide and atrocities prevention, which calls for the federal government to outline steps it is taking to prevent and halt such actions abroad. “This administration will defend and protect human rights around the world, and recognises the prevention of atrocities is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility,"" it said.The report said the US continues to believe that China's actions against the Uyghurs constitutes a “genocide.” That finding was first announced by former President Donald Trump's administration, as was a determination that Myanmar was engaged in “ethnic cleansing” against Rohyinga Muslims in its northern Rakhine state.The report noted that Secretary of State Antony Blinken has several times reaffirmed the previous administration's claim that “the People's Republic of China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.” Those crimes include imprisonment, torture, enforced sterilization, and persecution, the report said. It added that President Joe Biden's administration has followed through and expanded on Trump-era sanctions for the alleged atrocities.The report said Myanmar, also known as Burma, remains at particular risk for genocide. It said the U.S. would continue to coordinate with allies and partners to press the military government there to halt all repression, including crackdowns on dissent that followed a coup in February, as well as the violence against the Rohingya.The report also took Eritrea and Ethiopia to task for ethnic cleansing in their crackdown on dissent in Ethiopia's western Tigray region. Blinken in March told Congress that the actions there amounted to “ethnic cleansing.” The administration has since demanded a full withdrawal of Eritrean forces from Tigray and has imposed travel bans on certain officials.Elsewhere in Africa, the report cited deteriorating conditions in South Sudan, where it said the government “has perpetrated extrajudicial killings including ethnic-based killings of civilians, widespread sexual violence, and use of food as a weapon of war.” “Those responsible for human rights violations in South Sudan must be held to account,” it said.The report said the Biden administration would continue to support efforts to bring Islamic State militants to justice for atrocities committed against religious minorities in Iraq and Syria. It also reiterated the U.S. commitment to holding Syrian President Bashar Assad and his government to account for abuses. "

I would want to see strong job numbers,"" he said.Powell also said that US inflation will ""remain elevated"" in the coming months before moderating to normal levels due to supply bottlenecks.""As the economy continues to open, we're seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond,"" he said, adding inflation could turn out to be ""higher and more persistent"" than the Fed expected.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

He said a combination of testing and social isolation clearly works.""The current phase has a lot of cases in rich countries. With the right actions including the testing and social distancing (which I call 'shut down'), within 2-3 months the rich countries should have avoided high levels of infection,"" Gates wrote in response to another question.""I worry about all the economic damage but even worse will be how this will affect the developing countries who cannot do the social distancing the same way as rich countries and whose hospital capacity is much lower,"" he said.He said the Gates Foundation has committed up to USD 100 million to help with the COVID-19 response around the world, as well as USD 5 million to support his home state of Washington, which after New York is one of the most hit by the coronavirus.The foundation, Gates said, is working with all the groups who make diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines to make sure the right efforts are prioritised.""We want to make sure all countries get access to these tools. We donated USD 100 m in February for a variety of things and we will be doing more.""One priority is to make sure that there is enough manufacturing capacity for therapeutics and vaccines.

It's a pandemic of the unvaccinated...It's taking a needless toll on our country,"" Biden added.The country is witnessing a resurgence of new Covid-19 cases attributed to the spread of the highly-contagious Delta variant while millions of Americans remain unvaccinated.Following Biden's remarks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday that 50 per cent of the US population, more than 165.9 million people, have been fully vaccinated against the virus.More than 193.7 million, or 58.4 per cent of all Americans, have gotten at least one dose, the CDC said.Earlier this week, 70 per cent of US adults had received at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine, a month behind President Biden's Fourth of July goal.The first Covid-19 vaccine in the US was administered on December 14, 2020.   /* .jw-reset-text, .jw-reset{line-height: 2em;}*/ .jw-time-tip .jw-time-chapter{display:none;}   if ('' == comscore_jw_loaded || 'undefined' == comscore_jw_loaded || undefined == comscore_jw_loaded) { var comscore_jw_loaded = 1;

b8882359291847ec129c564d27a8b125,"China on Tuesday denied its fighter jet pilots operated dangerously during an encounter with a US surveillance plane+ in international airspace in which the American pilot took evasive action to avoid a possible collision. Spokesman Ren Guoqiang said in a statement on the defence ministry's microblog that the performance of the pilots of the two J-10 fighters was ""legal, necessary and professional.""Ren criticized frequent close-in surveillance runs by US planes as raising the chance of accidents, saying such missions ""threatened China's national security, harmed China-US sea-air military safety, endangered the safety of pilots from the two sides and were the root cause of China-US sea-air unexpected incidents.""The US should stop such ""unsafe, unprofessional and unfriendly military activities,"" Ren said, in a repetition of China's standard policy toward US surveillance missions intended at collecting Chinese computer and voice data in hopes of gaining insight into the workings of the People's Liberation Army.Asked about the incident at a daily briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Beijing objected to such missions but remained ""committed to building military mutual trust with other countries.""US Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said the Chinese fighters intercepted the US EP-3 surveillance plane on Sunday in international airspace between the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, in an area he described as west of the Korean Peninsula.Davis said one of the Chinese planes approached at a high rate of speed from beneath the American plane, then slowed and pulled up, prompting the EP-3 pilot to take evasive action. He called the Chinese pilot's move unsafe.China in 2013 declared an air defense identification zone over a partly contested portion of the East China Sea, demanding foreign aircraft declare their presence and follow Chinese orders. The US and others swiftly dismissed the zone as invalid and have largely ignored it. It wasn't clear if Sunday's encounter+ took place inside the zone.Such incidents continue to occur despite an agreement between the two sides to prevent them from sparking an international crisis, as happened in April 2001 when a Chinese jet fighter collided with a US EP-3. That led to the death of the Chinese pilot and China's detention of the US air crew for 10 days after their crippled plane landed at a PLA Navy air base on the island province of Hainan.While China has long chafed at US surveillance operations targeting its military, the PLA itself has been conducting such missions further and further from its home ports.Earlier this month, China sailed a spy ship through the narrow Tsugaru Strait separating the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido, while another was spotted last week within Australia's exclusive economic zone where allies Australia and US were conducting major war games."

A collective lot of a gem-set gold forehead pendant, or chand-tikka, a gem-set gold mirrored roundel and a pearl-mounted gold pendant went under the hammer for over 62,500 pounds and other rare artefacts dating back to the 19th century also attracted many bids at the Bonhams Islamic and Indian Art sale this week.""As the only surviving widow of Ranjit Singh, Jindan Kaur (1817-1863) led a spirited resistance to the encroachment of the British into Punjab but was eventually forced to surrender. More than 600 pieces of her jewellery from the legendary treasury of Lahore were confiscated, and she was imprisoned before escaping to Nepal in 1848,"" notes Bonhams, in reference to the jewellery.The auction house believes the jewellery in the sale this week was almost certainly within the casket of jewels handed back to Maharani Jindan Kaur by the British authorities when she agreed to live in London with her son, Duleep Singh, with whom she was reunited in Calcutta in 1861.Although Prince Duleep Singh eventually returned to Lahore, his eldest daughter Princess Bamba remained in England, where she had been born and raised, and went on to attend Oxford University and medical school in the US. A frequent visitor to her ancestral home, the Princess eventually settled permanently in Lahore towards the end of her life, presenting the jewels to her companion and friend, Mrs Dora Crowe.""These are wonderful jewels in their own right, made more special still by their rich and fascinating history – the circular stoned gold and the mirrored brooch was, according to Princess Bamba, formerly part of Maharajah Duleep Singh's horse harness. They represent a remarkable link back to one of the richest treasuries in the world,"" said Oliver White, Bonhams Head of Islamic and Indian Art.Some of the other highlights from the auction included a rare and large 19th-century panoramic watercolour view of the Golden Temple and the city of Amritsar, attributed to Cyril Herbert (1847-1882). The painting, believed to be the largest depiction of the Golden Temple in watercolour ever to have come onto the market, went under the hammer for 75,062 pounds.Some of the other Indian treasures included a large and impressive portrait by Colesworthy Grant of Rajah Shere Singh Attariwala – a formidable commander during the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848-49), once owned by the Marquess of Dalhousie, Governor-General of India.""The Sikh Khalsa Army was under his command at the Battle of Chillianwallah in January 1849, one of the hardest fought battles in the history of the British Army. After the defeat at the Battle of Gujarat in February 1849, he was imprisoned at Allahabad and later transferred to Fort William, Calcutta until January 1854. He died in exile in Benares in 1858,” notes the associated history.A portrait of Sikh Guru Gobind Singh, captioned in Gurmukhi script with the words 'vah vah gobind singh ape gur-chela', or wondrous, wondrous is Gobind Singh, he himself is the Guru and the disciple; and four paintings from an album depicting tradespeople, entertainers and fakirs from 19th century Punjab were also among the lots to go under the hammer. "

But given Russia's attacks on the Ukrainian coastline from the sea, the U.S. has provided “a range of intelligence” that includes locations of those ships, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.ALSO READ: Russia Ukraine War: 600 dead in Mariupol theater airstrike? Here's what report saysThe Biden administration has ramped up intelligence sharing with Ukraine alongside the shipment of arms and missiles to help it repel Russia's invasion. The disclosure of U.S. support in the Moskva strike comes as the White House is under pressure from Republicans to do more to support Ukraine's resistance and as polls suggest Americans question whether President Joe Biden is being tough enough on Russia.Since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion in February, the White House has tried to balance supporting Ukraine, a democratic ally, against not doing anything that would seem to provoke a direct war between Putin and the U.S. and NATO allies. As the war has gone on, the White House has ramped up its military and intelligence support, removing some time and geographic limits on what it will tell Ukraine about potential Russian targets.ALSO READ: Is Vladimir Putin suffering from cancer? Russian prez may even temporarily hand over power, reports suggestThe official who spoke Thursday said the U.S. was not aware that Ukraine planned to strike the Moskva until after they conducted the operation. NBC News first reported on the American role in the sinking of the ship.Speaking earlier Thursday after a New York Times report about the U.S. role in supporting Ukraine's killing of Russian generals, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said American agencies ""do not provide intelligence on the location of senior military leaders on the battlefield or participate in the targeting decisions of the Ukrainian military.”“Ukraine combines information that we and other partners provide with the intel that they themselves are gathering and then they make their own decisions and they take their own actions,"" Kirby said."

The Ministry of Information cited the local fire service when giving the death toll at the site of the landslide in Hpakant in Kachin state.The area is 950 kilometers (600 miles) north of Myanmar’s biggest city, Yangon, and is the center of the world’s biggest and most lucrative jade mining industry.A lawmaker from Hpakant, Khin Maung Myint, said local rescue services told him 99 bodies had been recovered and 54 injured people were sent to three hospitals.The website of 7Day News Journal reported earlier that 200 people were unaccounted for.Other details of the accident were not immediately available.Accidents at such mining sites causing multiple casualties are not rare.The victims are normally freelance miners who settle near giant mounds of discarded earth that has been mined in bulk by heavy machinery. The freelance miners who scavenge for bits of jade usually work and live at the base of the mounds of earth, which become particularly unstable during the rainy season.(With AP inputs)Also Read | Earthquake of intensity 5.9 hits Myanmar-India borderAlso Read | Scientists discover six new coronaviruses in bats in Myanmar"

48f22fd6bcc5f6d9662b0add5ed74bc5,"Kim did not have surgery amid lingering rumorsNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un did not undergo surgery or any other medical procedure, a South Korean official said Sunday, amid speculation about his health that continues to linger even after he reappeared publicly in recent days. North Korea had said Saturday that Kim attended the completion of a fertilizer factory near Pyongyang on Friday, in his first public appearance in about 20 days.While Kim’s reemergence, captured on video footage released by North Korean state media, quelled intense rumors that he might be gravely ill or even have died, some media outlets and observers still raised questions about Kim’s health, citing moments when his walking looked a bit stiff at the factory.A senior South Korean presidential official told reporters Sunday that the government has determined that Kim did not have surgery or any other procedure, according to the presidential Blue House.South Korea has a spotty record in confirming developments in North Korea, one of the world’s most secretive countries. But when rumors about Kim’s health surfaced in recent weeks, the South Korean government steadfastly dismissed them as baseless and maintained there were no unusual activities in the North.It wasn’t the first time Kim had disappeared from public view for an extended period. In 2014, when he reappeared after a six-week absence, he walked with a cane and used an electric cart. The North Korea-provided footage on Saturday showed Kim riding an electric cart similar to the one he used in 2014, when he was reported to have an ankle injury.Kim, 36, is the third generation of his family to govern North Korea with an iron fist that tolerates no dissent. He hasn’t publicly anointed his successor, and rumors about his health triggered worries about the North’s political stability and its nuclear program.In 2018, Kim entered talks with President Donald Trump on the fate of his nuclear arsenal, but their diplomacy has been deadlocked in recent months. Trump tweeted Saturday that “I, for one, am glad to see he is back, and well!”North Korea hasn’t explained Kim’s absence, including why he missed the April 15 commemoration of the birthday anniversary of his late grandfather and North Korea’s founder, Kim Il Sung. It’s the North’s most important state anniversary, and Kim hadn’t skipped the event since taking power in late 2011 upon his father Kim Jong Il’s death."

Westminster Magistrates’ Court Chief Magistrate Judge Emma Arbuthnot ruled that Mallya can be extradited to India to stand trial on the charges brought by the CBI and ED. The extradition case was then referred to Secretary of State by the judge.Reacting the court order, CBI spokesperson said, ""We hope to bring him soon and conclude the case. CBI has its own inherent strengths. We worked hard on this case. We are strong on Law and facts and we were confident while pursuing extradition process.""Related Stories Vijay Mallya's two helicopters auctioned for over Rs 8 crore ED 'resisted' my efforts to repay banks, says Vijay Mallya in court13 Indian banks lost out about 40 million pounds in 'unfair' sale process of Vijay Mallya's Force IndiaDelhi court orders attachment of Vijay Mallya's properties in BengaluruED rejects application to stay proceedings to declare Vijay Mallya as ‘fugitive economic offender’Vijay Mallya faces setback in case to save London homeBombay HC rejects Vijay Mallya's plea for stay on ED's request to declare him 'fugitive economic offender'Vijay Mallya's Central London mansion to be seized by Swiss Banking giant UBS, rules UK HCVijay Mallya makes 'humble' appeal, offers to repay '100 per cent' to banks, says 'please take it'SC issues notice to ED on Mallya’s plea challenging proceedings to declare him fugitive economic offenderVijay Mallya Extradition case: UK Court to pronounce judgment today | KEY POINTSReacting to the court order, Mallya said that his legal team is working on it.""My legal team will review the judgement in detail and consider various options and then I will decide going forward. There is nothing to be shocked about,"" said Mallya. Earlier in the day, Mallya had sought to disprove the narrative that he has ""stolen"" money and said his offer to repay the principal amount to the Indian banks was ""not bogus"".Mallya on December 5 had made a “humble request” to the Indian officials to accept his offer to pay back the ""100 per cent"" of the principal amount of loans he owed to various banks.The embattled liquor tycoon said that the value of his assets is more than enough to pay everybody and that is exactly what he was focusing on.""I want to disprove the narrative that I have stolen (money),"" he said.He said his legal team will review the judgment and take proper steps thereafter.Accused in alleged fraud and money laundering charges amounting to an estimated Rs 9,000 crores, Mallya had arrived in Westminster Magistrates’ Court, where the verdict was due after a year-long trial.The 62-year-old former Kingfisher Airlines boss had been on bail since his arrest on an extradition warrant in April last year.Mallya has contested his extradition on the grounds that the case against him is ""politically motivated"" and the loans he has been accused of defrauding on were sought to keep his now-defunct airline afloat.""I did not borrow a single rupee. The borrower was Kingfisher Airlines. Money was lost due to a genuine and sad business failure. Being held as guarantor is not fraud,"" he said in his most recent Twitter post on the issue.""I have offered to repay 100 per cent of the principal amount to them. Please take it,"" he had tweeted earlier.The trial, which opened at the Magistrates’ Court on December 4 last year, has gone through a series of hearings beyond the initial seven days earmarked for it.It opened with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) team, led by Mark Summers, laying out the Indian government's prima facie case of fraud and money laundering against Mallya.Mallya's defence team, led by Clare Montgomery, deposed a series of experts in an attempt to prove that the erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines’ alleged default of bank loans was the result of business failure rather than ""dishonest"" and ""fraudulent"" activity by its owner.The court was also told that a consortium of Indian banks, led by State Bank of India (SBI), had rejected an offer by the liquor baron in early 2016 to pay back nearly 80 per cent of the principal loan amount owed to them.While the CPS argued that Mallya never intended to repay the loans he sought in the first place because his airline's demise was inevitable, the defence tried to establish that Kingfisher Airlines was suffering from consequences of a wider global financial crisis around 2009-2010 and that its failure was a result of factors beyond the company's control.""There are clear signs that the banks seem to have gone against their own guidelines [in sanctioning some of the loans],"" Judge Arbuthnot had noted during the course of the trial.In case the concerned individual does not file an appeal, and Secretary of State agrees with the magistrate's decision, then the individual must be extradited from the UK within 28 days of the Home Secretary's extradition order.The judgment marks a significant point in this high-profile extradition trial that has lasted for over a year.(With PTI inputs)WATCH VIDEO: Aaj Ki Baat with Rajat Sharma | December 10, 2018 Watch full news here:{youtube:youtube.com/watch?v= tDv8MoS0FeM&feature=youtu.be}"
08d03ef7b187c022019f27c6b5304f92,"A fly lands on the head of Vice President Mike Pence during the vice presidential debate at Kingsbury Hall on the campus of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The vice presidential debate featured plexiglass barriers to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. They were no match for the night’s most talked-about intruder — a fly that briefly buzzed around the stage before landing and staying on Mike Pence’s head.The incident went unmentioned onstage, with the Republican vice president and Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris continuing to focus on the discussion of systemic racism in the justice system.But as the insect took up residence on Pence’s white hair, the social media firestorm was immediate — and intense. It easily created more, well, buzz than nearly anything else that occurred.“That’s not on your TV. It’s on his head,” tweeted MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. “The fly knows,” tweeted author Stephen King. Others joked about the creature perhaps getting stuck in hair spray — or possibly now being a prime candidate for coronavirus testing.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden immediately got in on the act, tweeting a photo of himself clutching an orange flyswatter under the heading “Pitch in $5 to help this campaign fly.” Moments later, he tweeted again, this time highlighting “Flywillvote.com,” which took users to a website set up for his campaign to help supporters make plans to vote.Pence had spent much of the night shaking his head in response to Harris’ answers. But the vice president didn’t appear to notice the fly’s arrival. Despite his talking and normal body movements, the hot stage lights and those virus-fighting barriers, the fly was unperturbed. It finally flew away on its own.Wednesday night’s visitor wasn’t the first fly to take center stage at a presidential debate. In 2016, one briefly landed between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s eyes during a town hall-style debate with now-President Donald Trump. Clinton didn’t flinch.President Barack Obama, however, took action when confronted with an airborne distraction during the taping of a television interview in 2009. Obama stopped speaking to swat at a buzzing fly and tell it to “get out of here.” As interviewer John Harwood quipped, “That’s the most persistent fly I’ve ever seen,” Obama concentrated on its path and swatted it dead."

727daebfd92e004900fecdef33a127c3,"FILE - Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi waits to address judges of the International Court of Justice on the second day of three days of hearings in The Hague, Netherlands on Dec. 11, 2019.An army vehicle barreled into a peaceful march of anti-government protesters in military-ruled Myanmar’s biggest city on Sunday, reportedly killing at least three people, witnesses and a protest organizer said.Sunday’s march was one of at least three held in Yangon, and similar rallies were reported in other parts of the country a day ahead of an expected verdict in the first of about a dozen criminal cases against Myanmar civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was toppled in a military takeover Feb. 1.A video posted on social media showed a speeding small army truck heading into the marchers from behind. Voices can be heard, saying: “The car is coming ... Please help! It hit the children ... Oh! ... Dead! ... Run, ... run!” The video shows about a dozen people running from the spot.A witness told The Associated Press that the protesters had been on his street for just two minutes when the military truck hit them, leaving three people without any sign of movement lying on the road.“About five armed soldiers got out of the vehicle and chased after the protesters,” said the witness, who insisted on anonymity for fear of arrest. “They opened fire and also arrested young people who had been hit by the car. At least 10 people were arrested.”Security forces have previously used cars to attack protesters since the army took power. They have also freely used live ammunition, killing about 1,300 civilians, according to a detailed list compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.The use of lethal force by the army and police has led to less large-scale street protests, which have been replaced by small, quickly organized marches that usually break up at the first sight of the authorities.Sunday’s deaths in Yangon’s Kyeemyindaing neighborhood could not be immediately confirmed.Another witness said that when several people came to gather their items, three more military vehicles arrived and arrested several of them.“At least four people, including two young girls who were crying near the shoes, were arrested,” he said. “The soldiers told us to go inside or they would shoot us.”About 30 people took part in the march, according to a member of Yangon People’s Strike, the local resistance group that organized it. Media posted online showed the protesters carrying placards with Suu Kyi’s image, and calling for the immediate release of the country’s detained civilian leaders.The organizer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the threat of arrest, said the group held such protests to keep the residents involved in the struggle against the military-installed government.At the same time, militant urban guerrilla groups have attacked officials and planted bombs, while open armed conflict had engulfed rural areas, leading to a warning the country may slide into civil war.Since she was detained by the military, Suu Kyi has faced charges from breaching coronavirus regulations to corruption. They’re seen as contrived in order to discredit her and justify the military takeover.The army claims it acted because last November’s election was marked by widespread electoral fraud. Independent observers of the polls, won by Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party, say have seen no evidence justifying the army’s claim."

4a6e69442ca27b86e188b6266cd38c06,"It's important to get clear idea about source of coronavirus: Chinese PremierAs China battled to deflect the criticism over the origin of the novel coronavirus from Wuhan, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that it was important to get a clear idea of the source of the deadly virus as he backed efforts to find it on the basis of science.After staunchly denying the US allegations of coronavirus originating from a bio-lab in its first epicentre Wuhan, Chinese researchers on Wednesday debunked widely reported view that the deadly virus emanated from a wet market in the city selling live animals.Recent Shanghai-based research targeting local confirmed cases of coronavirus once again proved that the attacks on a seafood market in Wuhan for originating the virus is nonsense, official media reported.The results of the study, being published on the website of top academic journal Nature on May 20, implied the Huanan Seafood Market in Hubei's capital Wuhan may not be the birthplace of COVID-19, although the virus outbreak emerged in Wuhan had a strong link to contacts with the market, state-run Global Times reported.Asked about the controversy related to the virus and the recent resolution passed by the World Health Assembly to conduct comprehensive study of the virus, Li in his annual press conference here said tha the virus caught everyone by surprise as it is a new disease.Li headed the leading group of officials in China which dealt with the coronavirus with the lockdown of Wuhan from January 23.""China and many other countries believe it is important to get a clear idea of the source of the new coronavirus,"" Li said.China is one of the co-sponsors of the resolution at the WHA, he said, adding that ""we believe that getting clear of the source of virus on the basis of science will help us to contain the spread of COVID-19.""Avoiding to dwell into the controversy over its origin, Li said China will continue to adopt a science-based open and transparent approach in dealing with COVID-19.China is open to international cooperation on the research and development of vaccines, medicines and testing reagents for COVID-19, and is willing to share the deliverables with the world, Li added.He said although China successfully brought the coronavirus under control, the country has “not yet come to complete end of it yet. There are still sporadic cases in China. Scientists have cautioned us to stay on high alert to prevent a resurgence of the disease”.""We must continue to adopt a science-based open and transparent approach in dealing with COVID-19,"" he said. ""Any infection must be promptly handled and no cover-up will be allowed.""""Many people say COVID-19 may not end soon and we may have to live with it for quite some time to come. All countries are confronted with dual challenges. It is like doing double exams.

The incidents took place on Friday, following which section 144 has been imposed in the areas to keep the situation under control. First, several local media reports claimed that Durga Puja pandals and idols were vandalised in Bangladesh, following which the Hindu leaders announced they would not immerse Durga idols in protest against the vandalism of the JM Sen Hall's puja venue, in the presence of police. They also demanded the removal of a police officer. Hours later, devotees at ISKCON temple were attacked.  What happened at Durga Puja pandal attack in Bangladesh Advocate Rana Dasgupta, leader of the Hindu, Buddhist, Christian Unity Council, called a half-day strike on Saturday in Chittagong. ""Details will be announced in a press conference in Chittagong Press club,"" Dasgupta told IANS on Friday evening. Following the Friday prayers, a group of people held a meeting at the gate of Andarkilla Jummah mosque and then marched towards JM Sen Hall in a procession, according to witnesses. The procession broke through police barricades at the intersection and then attempted to breach the locked gate of JM Sen Hall. Then they proceeded to throw brickbats and rip apart puja banners on the walls around the street. Advocate Kankan Dev, one of the witnesses told IANS: ""We had the plan to start to immerse the idols in the sea after 2.30 p.m. Suddenly we saw them coming... and all the police officers disappeared while the mob was throwing brickbats and tearing down festival banners."" Amid the violence, female devotees protected the idol from the attackers. ""The leaders of the council, which had organised the puja celebration at JM Sen Hall, declared that they will not carry out immersion of the idols to end the festival unless the police officials punished for the security is ensured,"" Dasgupta told IANS. ""Immersion begins from 11 a.m. every year. But the government directed us to get out of the pavillion after 2.30 p.m. this time around due to the Friday prayers. Is there any assurance of safety on the streets when our idols, pandals, and pavilions are being attacked? ""Let the government speak of our safety, then we will immerse the idols. Until then, no pandals in Chittagong metropolitan will carry out idol immersions,"" he added. At around 3 p.m., Dasgupta arrived at the JM Sen Hall intersection and expressed solidarity with the puja celebration council. Announcing the strike from 6 a.m to 12 p.m. (Saturday), and vowing to continue demonstrations, he said: ""We are ready to shed blood if anyone attempts to hinder our demonstration."" AJM Nasir Uddin, General Secretary of Chittagong City Awami League, meanwhile, urged the devotees, who protested against his anti-people and anti-Hasina role, to withdraw their announcement. Later, Nasir took away the idols from JM Sen Hall with police protection to immerse the idols of Goddess Durga, which in turn annoyed the Hindu devotees. Meanwhile, Saleh Mohammed Tanvir, Commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP), and SI Bijoy Basak additional commissioner of Chattogram police (south) asked Dasgupta to withdraw his strike demand. In response, he said: ""As chief of CMP, you have denied protecting the minority and their temple... We want justice against the atrocity and attack on the minorities.

Taliban officials of the Ministry of Information and Culture of the caretaker cabinet on Thursday notified of the development on Thursday. Tolo News reported that Ahmadullah Wasiq, Deputy head of the Cultural Commission of the cabinet, said their assessments show that items of the national museum, the national archive and the national gallery and other historical and ancient monuments are safe in their locations.Wasiq also said that they have assigned the relevant departments to find and check on the Bactrian treasure recognized as one of the biggest collections of gold in the world. Wasiq said standing agreements with international organizations to preserve sites and artefacts will be respected. ""The issue is under investigation, and we will collect information to know what the reality is. If it has been transferred (out of Afghanistan), it is treason against Afghanistan. The government of Afghanistan will take serious actions if this and other ancient items are moved out of the country,"" he said.The Bactrian treasure is an important asset of Afghanistan that was brought to the Presidential Palace by the former government in February 2021 and was put on display for the people. However, after the collapse of the former government, concerns were raised over its safety. The collection is composed of jewels and gold and was discovered at an ancient royal cemetery site.
